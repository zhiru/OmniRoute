# /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules and reports 9 HIGH/MEDIUM CVEs.
#
# Refreshing npm does NOT fix them. Measured on npm@12.0.2 (2026-08-12, latest):
#   brace-expansion 5.0.7  (needs >= 5.0.9)   CVE-2026-69152, CVE-2026-14257
#   ip-address      10.2.0 (needs >= 10.5.1)  CVE-2026-69192/-69198/-54272 + the

#   tar             7.5.19 (needs >= 7.5.21)  GHSA-r292-9mhp-454m
#   undici          6.27.0 (needs >= 6.28.0)  CVE-2026-16729/-16728/-15157
# No published npm release carries patched copies, so `npm install -g npm@latest`
# alone was pure build time for zero CVEs — it is kept only to land on a known,
# current npm tree, and the patched copies are overlaid on top below.
#
# Deleting npm from the runner stages is NOT an option: the application shells
# out to npm at runtime (src/lib/services/installers/utils.ts::runNpm for the
# embedded services, src/lib/system/{autoUpdate,globalPackagePath}.ts,
# src/app/api/system/version). The previous version of this comment claimed the
# opposite; it was wrong.
#
# The overlay is semver-compatible with the ranges npm's own tree declares
# (minimatch → brace-expansion ^5.0.5, socks → ip-address ^10.1.1, node-gyp →
# tar ^7.5.4 and undici ^6.25.0 — hence undici stays on the 6.x line, NOT 8.x).
# --install-strategy=nested makes each replacement self-contained, so it cannot
# perturb the versions the rest of npm's flat tree resolves.

# live VPS reproduction (issue #7518, dmesg OOM-killer report) measured the
# real per-process RSS directly at ~4.5 GB, independent of the NODE_OPTIONS
# heap flag (Turbopack itself is native/Rust, outside the V8 heap) — and it
# applies to the parent process too, not just workers. 2 workers (3 processes
# × 4.5 GB = 13.5 GB) still didn't fit the 12.288 GB (75%) budget on a 16 GB
# runner, matching the still-live publish failures after #11419 merged. 1
# worker (2 processes × 4.5 GB = 9 GB) fits with headroom to spare.
