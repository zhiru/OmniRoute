/**
 * Guard for the same-provider cascade (issue #3200): when a combo has SEVERAL
 * targets from the same provider and that provider fails, the combo must NOT
 * cascade through every same-provider target before falling back.
 *
 * Finding (TDD investigation of PRs #3145 / #3169, 2026-06): the EXISTING
 * connection-cooldown already prevents this. After the FIRST same-provider
 * failure (404 here, also 5xx) the connection is marked unavailable, so every
 * remaining same-provider target is pre-screened out before dispatch — the
 * provider is hit exactly ONCE, then the combo falls back to a different
 * provider. This is stronger than PR #3145's provider-level counter (which would
 * try the provider twice before short-circuiting) and does not need the parallel
 * cooldown cache PR #3169 proposed. This test locks that behavior in so a future
 * change can't silently regress the cascade guard.
