/**
 * Regression for GitHub issue #13232 — "[BUG] Z.ai web error".
 *
 * The Z.ai web transport drives a real headed Chromium browser (via Playwright) to get past
 * Z.ai's CAPTCHA. When the local Playwright Chromium binary is missing,
 * `browserType.launch()` throws "Executable doesn't exist at ...". Before this fix, zai-web.ts
 * had no classification for that failure and surfaced it as a plain 502 with no fallback hint —
 * a status that trips the whole-provider circuit breaker (`AGENTS.md` → "Provider Circuit
 * Breaker") as if the upstream itself were failing, instead of applying the intended
 * host/config connection cooldown. This mirrors the exact failure class already handled for
 * Gemini Web in #3516 (`isMissingBrowserExecutable`, now shared via
 * `open-sse/executors/browserExecutableCheck.ts`).
