# scripts/release/merge-train.sh — batch-validate N queued PRs as ONE merged result.
#
# Why: in a merge-storm, waiting for each PR's CI after each sibling merge costs
# O(N²) CI runs. The train merges every queued PR into a throwaway worktree cut from
# the release tip, runs the fast-gates parity suite ONCE on the final result, and
# prints the evidence block that authorizes `gh pr merge --squash --admin` for each
# train member (merge-gates.md §7 — owner-approved policy extension of §4, 2026-07-09).
#
# Designed for the 32-core runner box (192.168.0.113) or any checkout with
# node_modules. It only READS from origin — it never pushes, never merges PRs, never
# touches other worktrees, and never uses `git stash` (Hard Rule #22a).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release/merge-train.sh [--plan] [--fast] <base-branch> <PR#> [<PR#>...]
#     --plan   print the planned steps and exit 0 (no worktree, no network) — used by
#              the unit test and for a quick sanity read.
#     --fast   fast parity mode (owner-approved 2026-07-18): full static gates + the
#              node:test files CHANGED by the boarded PRs + vitest, instead of the
#              full unit suite. For intra-day mega-train drains. The FULL suite must
#              still run at least once per day on the accumulated tip (one train
#              without --fast, or `npm run test:unit` on the tip) — fast evidence
#              lines say so explicitly.
#
# Speed note (2026-07-18): full mode runs `npm run test:unit` (box-tuned,
# --test-concurrency=20). The previous two SEQUENTIAL `test:unit:ci:shard` runs
# (--test-concurrency=4 each, sized for 4-core GH runners) drove the dominant phase
# at ~25% of a 16-core devbox (~2.5h suite → ~30-40min).
#
# Exit codes: 0 = suite green (evidence printed); 1 = usage error; 2 = suite red;
#             PRs whose merge conflicts are EJECTED (reported, train continues).
#             A static gate already red on origin/<base> with the SAME violations is
#             reported as INHERITED and does NOT stop the train (merge-gates.md §3);
#             exit 0 still happens, and the summary lists every inherited gate.

# A red gate is only the train's fault when it is GREEN on the untouched base.

# were already red on the release tip (docs counts, mutation coverage, two API
# typecheck errors). merge-gates.md §3 says to reproduce a failure on
# `origin/<base>` before calling it inherited; this does exactly that, automatically.
#
# Only the `npm run check:*` static gates are discriminated. The unit/vitest gates
# run files the boarded PRs added, which do not exist on the base at all, so a red
# there means "file not found", not "inherited" — those still abort and the
