# Contributing to OmniRoute

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide covers everything you need to get started.

For the official per-change workflow, start with the
[Contribution Golden Path](docs/ops/CONTRIBUTION_GOLDEN_PATH.md). It maps provider, routing,
UI/UX, i18n, CLI, database, and build/deploy changes to their contracts, focused tests, CI
coverage, and reconciliation steps.

---

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** `>=22.22.3 <23`, or `>=24.0.0 <27` (recommended: 24 LTS)
- **npm** 10+

> **npm v11+ users (Node 24+):** After `npm install`, verify native modules were installed:
> `node -e "require('better-sqlite3')"`. If it fails with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`,
> run `npm approve-scripts better-sqlite3 && npm install`. See
> [Troubleshooting](docs/guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#npm-v11-better-sqlite3-not-installed-cannot-find-module).

- **Git**

### Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute.git
cd OmniRoute
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Create your .env from the template
cp .env.example .env

# Generate required secrets
echo "JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 48)" >> .env
echo "API_KEY_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" >> .env
```

Key variables for development:

| Variable               | Development Default      | Description           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| `PORT`                 | `20128`                  | Server port           |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:20128` | Base URL for frontend |
| `JWT_SECRET`           | (generate above)         | JWT signing secret    |
| `INITIAL_PASSWORD`     | `CHANGEME`               | First login password  |
| `APP_LOG_LEVEL`        | `info`                   | Log verbosity level   |

### Dashboard Settings

The dashboard provides UI toggles for features that can also be configured via environment variables:

| Setting Location    | Toggle             | Description                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Settings → Advanced | Debug Mode         | Enable debug request logs (UI) |
| Settings → General  | Sidebar Visibility | Show/hide sidebar sections     |

These settings are stored in the database and persist across restarts, overriding env var defaults when set.

### Running Locally

```bash
# Development mode (hot reload)
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build    # next build → .build/next/ then assembleStandalone → dist/
npm run start

# Fast backend/API-only compile for contributor changes
npm run build:contributor

# Release build (clean rebuild + HEAD sentinel — required for deploy)
npm run build:release   # rm -rf .build dist && build + writes dist/BUILD_SHA

# Common port configuration
PORT=20128 NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:20128 npm run dev
```

The contributor build performs compile-only validation: it does not assemble the standalone
distribution or build optional native packaging assets. Use the regular production build when
you need to validate the shippable bundle.

### Build Output Layout

| Directory | Contents                                                                  | Tracked |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `src/`    | Application source (TypeScript / TSX)                                     | Yes     |
| `.build/` | Intermediates — `next build` output (gitignored, `distDir = .build/next`) | No      |
| `dist/`   | Shippable bundle — assembled by `assembleStandalone` (gitignored)         | No      |

The build pipeline is a single pass:

```
npm run build
  └─ next build → .build/next/standalone  (Next.js output)
  └─ assembleStandalone()                 (copies standalone + static + public + native assets)
       └─ output: dist/                   (server.js, .next/static/, public/, node_modules/)
```

`npm run build:release` additionally cleans both directories first and writes
`dist/BUILD_SHA` (= `git rev-parse --short HEAD`) as a deploy integrity sentinel.

`npm run build:contributor` uses the backend-only build profile. It temporarily stubs
dashboard UI files while building, keeps API route handlers, and restores the original files
after the build. Use `npm run build` for changes that affect the dashboard UI or for full
release validation; the contributor profile is not a replacement for the release build.

> **VPS deploy note:** the remote image directory `/usr/lib/node_modules/omniroute/app/`
> is unchanged. The deploy skills rsync the contents of `dist/` into it.
> Only the in-repo build output path moved (`app/` → `dist/`).

Default URLs:

- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:20128/dashboard`
- **API**: `http://localhost:20128/v1`

## Git Workflow

> ⚠️ **NEVER commit directly to `main`.** Always use feature branches.
>
> **PR base:** target the active `release/vX.Y.Z` branch (not `main`). See
> [`docs/ops/BRANCHING_MODEL.md`](docs/ops/BRANCHING_MODEL.md) for the
> release-per-branch + tag-at-ship model.

```bash
# Branch from the active release tip (example: release/v3.8.49)
git fetch origin
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name origin/release/v3.8.49
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "feat: describe your change"
git push -u origin feat/your-feature-name
# Open a Pull Request with base = release/v3.8.49
```

### Branch Naming

| Prefix      | Purpose                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `feat/`     | New features              |
| `fix/`      | Bug fixes                 |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring        |
| `docs/`     | Documentation changes     |
| `test/`     | Test additions/fixes      |
| `chore/`    | Tooling, CI, dependencies |

## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests (unit + vitest + ecosystem + e2e)
npm run test:all

# Single test file (Node.js native test runner — most tests use this)
node --import tsx/esm --test tests/unit/your-file.test.ts

# Only the unit tests impacted by your change (same TIA selector as the CI gate, #8084)
npm run test:scoped            # changes in the last commit (or the working tree)
npm run test:scoped:staged     # staged changes only — pairs well with a pre-commit run
npm run test:scoped:full       # rebuild the import-graph map first (after adding/moving files)
# Exit 1 + "run the full suite" means a hub file (tsconfig, package.json, …) or an
# unmapped source changed — the selector fails safe, it never silently skips.

# Vitest (MCP server, autoCombo, cache)
npm run test:vitest

# E2E tests (requires Playwright)
npm run test:e2e

# Protocol clients E2E (MCP transports, A2A)
npm run test:protocols:e2e

# Ecosystem compatibility tests
npm run test:ecosystem

# Coverage gate: 60% statements/lines/functions/branches
npm run test:coverage
npm run coverage:report

# Lint + format check
npm run lint
npm run check

# Gated real-upstream combo smoke (requires VPS access + real provider credits)
# Hits REAL providers — costs a little. NEVER runs in CI. Skips cleanly without the gate.
# Needs: ssh root@192.168.0.15 access (sources a read-only DB snapshot from the VPS).
RUN_COMBO_LIVE=1 npm run test:combo:live

# Phase-3 VPS live smoke — plain Node ESM scripts, hit the live .15 server directly.
# Requires: ssh root@192.168.0.15 access (combos created/torn down via SSH sqlite).
# Hits REAL providers (small cost). Creates/deletes only __live_test__* combos. NEVER runs in CI.
# REQUIRE_API_KEY=false on .15 so no API key needed, but honors COMBO_LIVE_BASE_URL / COMBO_LIVE_API_KEY if set.
npm run test:combo:live:vps              # 7 HTTP scenarios (priority/round-robin/weighted/cost/fusion/auto + health)
npm run test:combo:live:vps:failover     # adds a real cross-provider failover scenario (8 total)
```

Coverage notes:

- `npm run test:coverage` measures source coverage for the main unit test suite, excludes `tests/**`, and includes `open-sse/**`
- Pull requests must keep the coverage gate at **60%+** statements/lines/functions/branches
- If a PR changes production code in `src/`, `open-sse/`, `electron/`, or `bin/`, it must add or update automated tests in the same PR
- `npm run coverage:report` prints the detailed file-by-file report from the latest coverage run
- `npm run test:coverage:legacy` preserves the older metric for historical comparison
- See `docs/ops/COVERAGE_PLAN.md` for the phased coverage improvement roadmap

### Pull Request Requirements

Before opening a PR, use the
[Contribution Golden Path](docs/ops/CONTRIBUTION_GOLDEN_PATH.md) to run the focused loop for
what you changed. The full unit suite (4 CI shards), Vitest, the **60%+** coverage gate, and
the production build are CI's responsibility — running them locally adds no signal the PR
checks will not already give you, and on smaller machines it can saturate the host (#8084):

- Run the test files that cover your change: `node --import tsx/esm --test tests/unit/<file>.test.ts`
- Run `npm run lint`
- Include or update automated tests in the same PR whenever production code changes
- Include the changed or added test files in the PR description when production code changed
- Check the SonarQube result on the PR when the project secrets are configured in CI

Current test status: **122 unit test files** covering:

- Provider translators and format conversion
- Rate limiting, circuit breaker, and resilience
- Semantic cache, idempotency, progress tracking
- Database operations and schema (21 DB modules)
- OAuth flows and authentication
- API endpoint validation (Zod v4)
- MCP server tools and scope enforcement
- Memory and Skills systems

---

## Code Style

- **ESLint** — Run `npm run lint` before committing
- **Prettier** — Auto-formatted via `lint-staged` on commit (2 spaces, semicolons, double quotes, 100 char width, es5 trailing commas)
- **TypeScript** — All `src/` code uses `.ts`/`.tsx`; `open-sse/` uses `.ts`/`.js`; document with TSDoc (`@param`, `@returns`, `@throws`)
- **No `eval()`** — ESLint enforces `no-eval`, `no-implied-eval`, `no-new-func`
- **Zod validation** — Use Zod v4 schemas for all API input validation
- **Naming**: Files = camelCase/kebab-case, components = PascalCase, constants = UPPER_SNAKE

### Error handling / empty catch blocks

Never leave a `catch` unexplained. Classify it into one of two buckets (operationalizes
the hard rule "never silently swallow errors in SSE streams"):

- **Intentional (our own best-effort cleanup/telemetry)** — a failure here is expected and
  harmless; add a one-line rationale comment, no logging (logging on every request is the
  noise this convention avoids).

  ```ts
  } catch {} // closing an already-closed controller after client disconnect is expected
  ```

- **Should log (external/caller-supplied code, or the swallow changes control flow)** — keep
  the catch (never let it break the stream) but emit a contextual `console.debug`/`warn` so the
  failure is discoverable.

  ```ts
  } catch (e) {
    console.debug("[STREAM] onFailure callback error:", e);
  }
  ```

See `open-sse/utils/stream.ts` and `open-sse/utils/streamHandler.ts` for applied examples.

## Adding a New Provider

### Step 1: Register Provider Constants

Add to `src/shared/constants/providers.ts` — Zod-validated at module load.

### Step 2: Add Executor (if custom logic needed)

Create executor in `open-sse/executors/your-provider.ts` extending the base executor.

### Step 3: Add Translator (if non-OpenAI format)

Create request/response translators in `open-sse/translator/`.

### Step 4: Add OAuth Config (if OAuth-based)

Add OAuth credentials in `src/lib/oauth/constants/oauth.ts` and service in `src/lib/oauth/services/`.

If the upstream provider distributes a public OAuth client_id/secret or Firebase Web API key inside its public CLI / browser bundle, **do not** embed it as a string literal. Use `resolvePublicCred()` from `open-sse/utils/publicCreds.ts` and add a masked byte entry to `EMBEDDED_DEFAULTS`. The full mandatory workflow is documented in [`docs/security/PUBLIC_CREDS.md`](./docs/security/PUBLIC_CREDS.md).

Inside handlers/executors, error messages reaching the client must go through `buildErrorBody()` / `sanitizeErrorMessage()` from `open-sse/utils/error.ts` — never put raw `err.stack` or `err.message` in a Response body. See [`docs/security/ERROR_SANITIZATION.md`](./docs/security/ERROR_SANITIZATION.md).

### Step 5: Register Models

Add model definitions in `open-sse/config/providerRegistry.ts`.

### Step 6: Add Tests

Write unit tests in `tests/unit/` covering at minimum:

- Provider registration
- Request/response translation
- Error handling

## Releasing

Releases are managed via the `/generate-release` workflow. When a new GitHub Release is created, the package is **automatically published to npm** via GitHub Actions.

For VPS deploys, use `npm run build:release` (not `npm run build`) — it performs a clean
rebuild, assembles the bundle into `dist/`, and writes the `dist/BUILD_SHA` sentinel.
Then use the `/deploy-vps-*-cc` skills which rsync `dist/` to the remote `app/` directory.
