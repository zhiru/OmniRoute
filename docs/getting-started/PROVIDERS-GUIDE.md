# Providers Guide: Connect AI Models to OmniRoute

> **TL;DR**: A provider is a connection to an AI service (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). You need at least one provider to use OmniRoute.

---

## What Is a Provider?

Think of a provider like a **phone carrier**. Just as you need a phone carrier to make calls, you need an AI provider to use AI models. OmniRoute is like a phone that works with **all carriers** — you can switch between them automatically.

### Types of Providers

| Type           | What It Is                | Examples                          | Cost                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Free**       | No payment required       | Kiro, OpenCode Free, Pollinations | $0                     |
| **API Key**    | You need an API key       | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google         | Pay per use            |
| **OAuth**      | Login with your account   | Claude Code, GitHub Copilot       | Subscription           |
| **Web Cookie** | Uses your browser session | ChatGPT Web (Codex), Gemini Web   | $0 (uses your account) |

### Web Cookie Providers

## Quick Start: Connect Your First Provider

### Optional first-run free-provider setup

The first-run wizard offers an explicit **Set up free providers** card. It derives the current
eligible list from OmniRoute's no-auth provider registry, then lets you review and deselect each
provider before confirming. OmniRoute shows the provider's caution notice and a link to its site
so you can review third-party terms, privacy, availability, and rate limits first.

This action is optional: finishing the wizard never creates free-provider connections silently.
It creates only providers that are still missing, leaves existing customized connections
untouched, and reports created, already-configured, and failed providers individually. You can
safely retry only the failures after a partial result.

### Option A: Free Provider (No Credit Card)

1. Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:20128`
2. Go to **Providers** → **Add Provider**
3. Select one of these free providers:
   - **Kiro AI** — Free Claude models (no auth needed)
   - **OpenCode Free** — Free GPT models (no auth needed)
   - **Pollinations** — Free GPT-5, Claude, Gemini (no key needed)
   - **LongCat** — 10M tokens free (one-time grant, requires account + KYC)
   - **Cloudflare AI** — 50+ models, 10K neurons/day
   - **MLX Gemma 26B** — Local Apple Silicon model (~38.5 tok/s, ~15.9GB RAM)
   - **MLX Qwen 3.8 27B** — Local Apple Silicon model (~9.1 tok/s, ~13.1GB RAM)
4. Click **Connect**
5. Done! You now have free AI access.

### Option B: API Key Provider (Paid)

1. Get an API key from the provider's website:
   - **OpenAI**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - **Anthropic**: https://console.anthropic.com/
   - **Google**: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
   - **DeepSeek**: https://platform.deepseek.com/
   - **Groq**: https://console.groq.com/
2. Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:20128`
3. Go to **Providers** → **Add Provider**
4. Select your provider
5. Paste your API key
6. Click **Connect**
7. Done! You now have access to that provider's models.

### Option C: OAuth Provider (Subscription)

1. Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:20128`
2. Go to **Providers** → **Add Provider**
3. Select your provider (e.g., Claude Code, GitHub Copilot)
4. Click **Connect with OAuth**
5. Login with your account
6. Done! You now have access to your subscription models.

### Option D: Local MLX Models (Apple Silicon)

For Apple Silicon Macs with unified memory, OmniRoute supports connecting to local MLX models running via `mlx-lm.server` as regular OpenAI-compatible local providers.

#### Prerequisites

- **Apple Silicon Mac** (M1/M2/M3/M4) with 24GB+ unified memory recommended
- **uv** package manager: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **mlx-lm**: `uv pip install mlx-lm`

#### Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   # Install uv if not already installed
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # Install mlx-lm
   uv pip install mlx-lm
   ```

2. **Start MLX servers manually** (in separate terminals):

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Gemma 4 26B A4B IT-QAT (port 11435)
   uv run mlx_lm.server --model mlx-community/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-q4_0-mlx-aligned --port 11435 --host 127.0.0.1

   # Terminal 2: Qwen 3.8 27B MLX Mixed (port 11436)
   uv run mlx_lm.server --model maglun/Qwen3.8-27B-MLX-Mixed-3.80bpw --port 11436 --host 127.0.0.1
   ```

3. **Connect in OmniRoute Dashboard**:
   - Go to **Providers** → **Add Provider**
   - Select **MLX Gemma 26B** or **MLX Qwen 3.8 27B**
   - Click **Connect** (no API key needed)

4. **Use with OpenCode**:
   ```bash
   # Configure OpenCode to use OmniRoute
   opencode config set api.base_url http://localhost:20128/v1
   opencode config set api.key <your-omniroute-api-key>

   # Use MLX models
   opencode run --model mlx-gemma/gemma-4-26b
   opencode run --model mlx-qwen/qwen3.8-27b
   ```

#### Memory Management

**Important**: With 24GB unified memory, only **one large MLX model can run at a time**.

- Gemma 26B: ~15.9GB peak memory
- Qwen 3.8 27B: ~13.1GB peak memory

You must manage this manually:

- Run only one MLX server at a time, or
- Run both on separate machines, or
- Stop one before starting the other

OmniRoute does not automatically manage MLX server processes — it only routes requests to the OpenAI-compatible endpoints you configure.

#### Tool Calling Support

Both models support OpenAI-compatible tool calling. Test with:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:20128/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "mlx-gemma/gemma-4-26b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2? Use the calculator tool."}],
    "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "calculator", "description": "Calculate", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"expression": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["expression"]}}}]
  }'
```

#### Troubleshooting

| Issue              | Solution                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server won't start | Check `uv run mlx_lm.server --help` and verify model IDs                      |
| Out of memory      | Ensure only one model runs; close other apps; check Activity Monitor          |
| Connection refused | Verify server is running on correct port (11435/11436)                        |
| Slow responses     | First request loads model into memory (~30-60s); subsequent requests are fast |
| Tool calling fails | Ensure model supports tools; check OmniRoute logs for translation errors      |

## Using Multiple Providers

OmniRoute works best with **multiple providers**. This gives you:

- **Automatic fallback** — If one provider fails, OmniRoute tries the next
- **Cost optimization** — OmniRoute picks the cheapest provider for each request
- **Speed optimization** — OmniRoute picks the fastest provider for each request
- **Quality optimization** — OmniRoute picks the best provider for each task

### Recommended Setup

Connect at least **3 providers** for the best experience:

1. **One free provider** (Kiro, OpenCode Free, or Pollinations) — Always available
2. **One fast provider** (Groq, Cerebras) — For quick responses
3. **One quality provider** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) — For complex tasks

Then use `model: "auto"` and OmniRoute will automatically pick the best one for each request.

### Qoder: choose the credential transport

Qoder requires credentials. Its two transports have different capabilities; a model name
alone does not identify what a particular connection can do.

| Credential                      | OmniRoute transport                            | Caller tool calling                               | Streaming                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PAT beginning with `pt-`        | Local `qodercli` process on the OmniRoute host | Unsupported                                       | Buffered: SSE is emitted only after the CLI returns the full reply |
| Non-PAT access token or API key | DashScope OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint      | Passed through, subject to the upstream model/key | Upstream HTTP/SSE path                                             |

For a PAT, install the Qoder CLI on the same host or container as OmniRoute. The executable
must be discoverable as `qodercli`, or set `CLI_QODER_BIN` to its executable path. A CLI
installed only on the Docker host is not automatically present in the container. Missing
binaries produce an explicit error directing you to the installation or path setting.

The PAT chat path has a 45-second process timeout. It flattens the conversation into a
prompt and invokes the CLI in non-streaming print mode. Requesting `stream: true` changes
the response envelope to SSE; it does not provide incremental upstream token delivery.
CLI validation/model listing uses a separate 20-second timeout. These are current code
defaults, not configurable dashboard settings.

Use PAT connections for plain chat. Agent requests carrying `tools` or legacy `functions`
exclude PAT accounts during credential selection, including pinned combo targets. A mixed
Qoder pool can still select its HTTP account. Direct calls to the PAT executor also fail
explicitly before launching the CLI instead of silently dropping tool definitions. This
restriction concerns tools supplied by the API caller, not any internal tools the Qoder
CLI might use itself. An HTTP key does not guarantee every model supports tools; normal
model capability checks still apply.

Browser OAuth is available only when the administrator configures all five settings:
`QODER_OAUTH_AUTHORIZE_URL`, `QODER_OAUTH_TOKEN_URL`, `QODER_OAUTH_USERINFO_URL`,
`QODER_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, and `QODER_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`. They default to empty; an
unconfigured installation should use a supported credential import instead of assuming
that the browser sign-in flow is ready.

Implementation references: [Qoder executor](../../open-sse/executors/qoder.ts),
[CLI runtime](../../open-sse/services/qoderCli.ts), and
[OAuth configuration](../../src/lib/oauth/constants/oauth.ts). Incremental PAT streaming
and a configurable timeout are separate enhancements; this behavior does not promise them.

### Groq

1. Get API key: https://console.groq.com/
2. In OmniRoute: Providers → Add Provider → Groq
3. Paste API key → Connect

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to pay to use OmniRoute?"

**No!** OmniRoute is free and open-source. You can use free providers (Kiro, OpenCode Free, Pollinations) without paying anything. You only pay if you choose to use paid providers.

### "Which provider should I start with?"

Start with **Kiro AI** — it's free, requires no API key, and gives you access to Claude models. Then add more providers as needed.

### "Can I use multiple providers at once?"

**Yes!** That's the whole point of OmniRoute. Connect multiple providers and use `model: "auto"` to let OmniRoute pick the best one for each request.

### "What if a provider goes down?"

OmniRoute automatically skips failed providers and tries the next one. You don't need to do anything.

### "How do I disconnect a provider?"

Go to Providers → click on the provider → click **Disconnect**.

### "Can I use my existing API keys?"

**Yes!** If you already have API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc., you can use them in OmniRoute. Just paste them when connecting the provider.
