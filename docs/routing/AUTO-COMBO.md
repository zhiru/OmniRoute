## Zero-Config Auto-Routing (`auto/` prefix)

> **NEW:** No combo creation required. Use `auto/` prefix directly in any client.

### Quick Examples

| Model ID       | Variant | Behavior                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `auto`         | default | All connected providers, LKGP strategy, balanced weights                 |
| `auto/coding`  | coding  | Quality-first weights, suitable for code generation                      |
| `auto/fast`    | fast    | Low-latency weighted selection                                           |
| `auto/cheap`   | cheap   | Cost-optimized routing (lowest cost first)                               |
| `auto/offline` | offline | Favors providers with highest quota availability                         |
| `auto/smart`   | smart   | Quality-first + higher exploration rate (10%) for better model discovery |
| `auto/lkgp`    | lkgp    | Explicit LKGP (same as default `auto`)                                   |
| `auto/chaos`   | chaos   | Parallel fan-out, one model per provider (not fault injection)           |

### Category × Tier Composition (`auto/<category>:<tier>`)

OpenRouter-style suffixes separate **what kind of route** (category) from **how to optimize it** (tier), so you can compose them freely (#4235 Phase B, `open-sse/services/autoCombo/suffixComposition.ts`):

- **Categories** (filter the candidate pool by capability): `coding` · `reasoning` · `vision` · `chat` · `multimodal`. `vision`/`multimodal` keep vision-capable models; `reasoning` keeps reasoning/thinking models.
- **Tiers** (pick the scoring weights / pool filter): `fast` (ship-fast) · `cheap` (alias `floor`, cost-saver) · `reliable` (circuit-breaker health + latency stability) · `free` / `pro` (filter the pool by model tier via `classifyTier` — free-tier vs. premium).

| Example                | Resolves to                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auto/coding:fast`     | coding pool, low-latency weights                        |
| `auto/coding:cheap`    | coding pool, cost-optimized (alias `auto/coding:floor`) |
| `auto/reasoning:pro`   | reasoning/thinking models only, premium tier            |
| `auto/vision`          | vision-capable models (no tier → balanced weights)      |
| `auto/multimodal:free` | multimodal-capable models, free tier only               |

Any valid `auto/<category>[:<tier>]` resolves on demand; a curated subset is advertised in `/v1/models` and the dashboard (`AUTO_SUFFIX_VARIANTS` in `open-sse/services/autoCombo/builtinCatalog.ts`). Filtering is **fail-open** — if a constraint matches no connected models, the full pool is used so routing never breaks. The core scorer (`combo.ts`) is unchanged; the category/tier filter is applied in `buildAutoCandidates`.

> **Live model intelligence:** auto-routing fitness is informed by live **Arena ELO** rankings + **models.dev** tier data when the `ARENA_ELO_SYNC_ENABLED` flag is on (falls back to the static fitness map otherwise).

**How to use:**

```bash
# Any IDE or CLI tool that supports OpenAI format
Base URL: http://localhost:20128/v1
API Key:  <your-endpoint-key>

# In your code/config, set model to:
model: "auto"                 # balanced default
model: "auto/coding"          # best for coding tasks
model: "auto/fast"            # fastest available
model: "auto/cheap"           # cheapest per token
```

**What happens:**

1. OmniRoute detects `auto/` prefix in `src/sse/handlers/chat.ts`
2. Queries all **active provider connections** from the database
3. Filters to those with valid credentials (API key or OAuth token)
4. Determines the model per connection (`connection.defaultModel` or provider's first model)
5. Builds a **virtual combo** in-memory (not stored in DB)
6. Routes using the selected variant's weight profile + LKGP strategy

**Key properties:**

- ✅ **Always-on:** No toggle, no combo creation, no configuration needed
- ✅ **Dynamic:** Reflects current connected providers automatically
- ✅ **Session stickiness:** LKGP ensures last successful provider is prioritized
- ✅ **Multi-account aware:** Each provider connection becomes a separate candidate
- ✅ **No DB writes:** Virtual combo exists only for the request, zero persistence overhead

### Per-key candidate control (#7819, Level 1+2)

`GET /v1/auto-combo/{channel}/candidates` (`{channel}` = the suffix after `auto/`, or
the literal `auto` for the base channel) is a **read-only** endpoint that lists an
`auto/*` channel's current candidate pool decorated with live reachability, reusing
the existing resilience reads (never raw breaker `state`):

- provider circuit breaker — `getCircuitBreaker(provider).getStatus()` / `.canExecute()`
- connection cooldown — `rateLimitedUntil` / `testStatus` on the resolved
  `provider_connections` row
- model lockout — `isModelLocked(provider, connectionId, model)`

Each candidate also carries this API key's `excluded` flag. Exclusions are stored
per-API-key (`auto_candidate_overrides` table, migration `128`) — OmniRoute is
single-tenant with no `users` table, so `apiKeyId` is the closest real per-caller
identity — and enforced at the candidate-pool chokepoint in
`open-sse/services/autoCombo/virtualFactory.ts` via the pure, unit-tested
`filterExcludedCandidates()` (`open-sse/services/autoCombo/candidateOverrides.ts`).
The filter is **fail-open**: an unset apiKeyId/channel or a DB lookup failure both
leave the pool unfiltered, so an operator with no overrides configured sees routing
byte-identical to before this feature.

**Deferred to a follow-up issue:** per-candidate weights + explicit ordering (Level 3
— feeds into the existing weighted/priority strategy paths) and pinning a specific
`combo.ts` strategy per `auto/*` channel (Level 4). See the #7819 plan for the open
question on whether overrides should stay per-API-key or become global given the
single-tenant model.

**Behind the scenes:**

```txt
Request: { model: "auto/coding" }
   ↓
src/sse/handlers/chat.ts detects prefix
   ↓
createVirtualAutoCombo('coding') → candidatePool from active connections
   ↓
handleComboChat (same engine as persisted combos)
   ↓
Auto-scoring selects best provider/model per request
```

## Combo Names That Match a Real Model Id

A combo whose `name` is identical to a bare model id (e.g. a combo named
`gpt-5.5`) is an **intentional, supported pattern**, not a bug: it is the
mechanism for per-model-id provider fallback documented in
[#6940](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/6940). Because combo
resolution is checked before bare-model-id resolution
(`getComboForModel()` in `src/sse/services/model.ts`), a request for the bare
id `gpt-5.5` is routed through the combo's targets (e.g.
`acme-responses/gpt-5.5`, `backup-responses/gpt-5.5`) instead of straight to
a single provider — this reuses the combo-before-rewrite precedence built for
[#3227/#3233](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/3227) and is
regression-tested by `tests/unit/responses-combo-resolution-3227.test.ts` and
`tests/unit/combo-name-codex-responses-rewrite.test.ts`.

Creating or renaming a combo to a name that shadows a real model id is
**never rejected** — doing so would break this documented workflow. Instead
(#8530), `POST /api/combos` and `PUT /api/combos/[id]` attach a non-blocking
`warning` field to the response when the (new) name collides with a real
model id:

```json
{ "warning": { "code": "COMBO_NAME_SHADOWS_MODEL", "modelId": "gpt-5.5", "providerId": "openai" } }
```

At boot, `scanComboModelNameCollisionsAtBoot()`
(`src/instrumentation-node.ts`) also logs a one-line `[STARTUP]` warning
enumerating every existing combo that shadows a model id, so operators who
hit this by accident (rather than intentionally, per #6940) have a signal.
The detection helper lives in `src/lib/combos/modelNameCollision.ts`.

## Calling a Custom Combo From a Client

Persisted combos (Settings → Combos) are only used when the client sends the combo's **exact name** in the `model` field — there is no fuzzy or partial matching of the combo name, and no `auto/` prefix involved. Resolution order (`getComboForModel()` in `src/sse/services/model.ts`):

1. exact combo-name match (`model: "my-combo"`),
2. `combo/<name>` prefix (`model: "combo/my-combo"`),
3. model→combo glob mappings (`/api/model-combo-mappings`).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:20128/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"my-combo","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'
```

Two common pitfalls:

- **`auto` does not use your combos.** `auto`/`auto/*` builds its own zero-config candidate pool and only consults persisted combos if a combo is literally named `auto` (not recommended). To route through a combo, send its exact name — not `auto`.
- **`openrouter/auto` is a real paid OpenRouter product** ("Auto Best Available"), not an OmniRoute alias. It is the single static model entry of the OpenRouter registry (`open-sse/config/providers/registry/openrouter/index.ts`) and is billed separately. Use Settings → Routing → Hide paid models to exclude it from `auto` pools.

See [#7992](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/7992) and [#7111](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/issues/7111) for the original confusion this documents.

## How It Works (Persisted Auto-Combos)

The Auto-Combo Engine dynamically selects the best provider/model for each request using a **16-factor scoring function** (defined in `open-sse/services/autoCombo/scoring.ts` → `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS`). The default weights sum to `1.0`; custom weights are renormalized by `normalizeScoringWeights()`. Two of the sixteen — `cacheAffinity` and `resetWindowAffinity` — carry a default weight of `0`; `reliability` carries `0` in `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS` but `0.03` in generic packs and `0.04` in `reliability-first`, and `quality` carries `0.02` in packs (`0.03` in `quality-first`): they are still computed for every candidate, and `cacheAffinity` gates prompt-cache deduplication outside the score, so the zero-default factors simply do not vote by default while packs do.

> pattern as the connection-status penalty. A failed usage read is evidence about the telemetry,
> not the provider, so it ranks strictly below any real reading, including a confirmed 100%-used
> one, but is never hard-blocked or evicted. A provider with no cap reports `unlimited: true` and
> scores as full quota; a provider with no registered quota fetcher has no telemetry source at all

**Sum:** `0.1429 + 0.1605 + 0.1429 + 0.1143 + 0.0762 + (7 × 0.0476) + 0.00 + 0.00 + 0.03 + 0.00 = 1.0` as declared in `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS`; user-configured weights are renormalized into a distribution by `normalizeScoringWeights()` before scoring.

## Mode Packs

6 pre-defined weight profiles in `open-sse/services/autoCombo/modePacks.ts`. Each pack replaces the default weights outright to bias selection toward one goal. Every pack already sums to `1.0` (`0.9999` as printed at four decimals), so `normalizeScoringWeights()` has nothing meaningful to correct when a pack is active — the values below are, to rounding, the ones the scorer applies.

Notes:

- **Packs carry `quality` and `reliability`** (`quality 0.02`, `quality-first 0.03`; `reliability 0.03`, `reliability-first 0.04`) and replace the weight map wholesale (`weights = pack`, not a merge). `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS` carries `quality 0.03 / reliability 0`; selecting `balanced`/`default` keeps those defaults, selecting a pack uses the pack's values above. On a cold pool (no observations yet, so `quality 0.5` and `reliability 1`) these two factors add `+0.04` under a generic pack (`0.03 + 0.01`), `+0.045` under `quality-first` and `+0.05` under `reliability-first`.
- `tierAffinity`, `specificityMatch` and `resetWindowAffinity` are explicitly `0` in every pack.
- Each pack's emphasis at a glance:
  - **ship-fast** → latencyInv 0.3048 + health 0.2667 (low-latency, healthy connections)
  - **cost-saver** → costInv 0.3324 (cheapest tokens win)
  - **quality-first** → taskFit 0.3524 + stability 0.1429 + quality 0.03, the highest of any pack (best model for the task, consistent)
  - **offline-friendly** → quota 0.3324 + health 0.2667 (max headroom regardless of speed/cost)
  - **reliability-first** → health 0.3524 + stability 0.1905 + reliability 0.04, the highest of any pack (fewest surprises)
  - **chaos-mode** → health 0.4000 + taskFit 0.1905 (the weight pack `auto/chaos` assigns to its panel members; the parallel fan-out does not read these weights, and this is not a fault-injection profile, see [CHAOS-MODE.md](../guides/CHAOS-MODE.md#autochaos-parallel-fan-out))

### Per-Request Controls (headers) — #6023 / #6024 / #6025 / #3470

An `auto` combo can be steered **per request** via three headers, without mutating the
combo's stored config. These apply only to the `auto` strategy and only for the request
that carries them; the combo's saved `modePack`/`budgetCap`/`budgetFallback` are used
when the header is absent.

Signals are scoped to the current turn — everything after the last user message is ignored — so every request in a tool loop resolves to the same level (stateless per-turn pin, no session state, no mid-loop escalation that would break upstream prompt-cache prefixes). An explicit client reasoning field always wins. Scoped to requests whose upstream dispatch resolves to the OpenAI Chat Completions shape (`targetFormat === FORMATS.OPENAI`) — `reasoning_effort` is an OpenAI-shaped field, so the header is a no-op on a Claude- or Gemini-targeted request (see `open-sse/handlers/chatCore/adaptiveEffortWiring.ts`). |

```bash
# Force the fastest profile, cap this request at $0.05, and hard-block instead of overspending
curl -sS http://localhost:20128/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-OmniRoute-Mode: fast" \
  -H "X-OmniRoute-Budget: 0.05" \
  -H "X-OmniRoute-Budget-Fallback: strict" \
  -d '{"model":"auto","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

Resolution is a pure function (`open-sse/services/autoCombo/requestControls.ts`); the
resolved values feed the engine's existing `config.modePack` / `config.budgetCap` /
`config.budgetFallback` inputs. A combo's stored `config.budgetFallback` ("strict" |
"cheapest") sets the persistent policy; the header overrides it for a single request.

## All Routing Strategies

OmniRoute's combo engine supports **19 routing strategies** (declared in `src/shared/constants/routingStrategies.ts` → `ROUTING_STRATEGY_VALUES`). The Auto Combo engine itself is exposed under the `auto` strategy; the others are available for persisted combos.

### `weighted` semantics

`weighted` is a **proportional random draw per request**
(`open-sse/services/combo/targetSorters.ts` → `selectWeightedTarget`), not an equalizer:

- Each request draws **one** step with probability `weight / totalWeight`; the remaining steps
  are ordered by descending weight as the fallback chain for that request.
- A step whose weight is `0` (or missing) is **never drawn** while any other step has a
  weight > 0 — it can only serve as a fallback after the drawn step fails. Only when **all**
  weights are 0 does selection become uniform.
- Steps whose targets are all unavailable — provider circuit breaker `OPEN`, connection
  cooldown, model lockout — are removed from the draw before it happens
  (`open-sse/services/combo/targetResolution.ts`), so a single healthy step can temporarily
  win every request.
- `stickyWeightedLimit` (combo config, default `1` = off) pins the drawn step for that many
  consecutive successes before re-drawing.

For strict rotation use `round-robin`; equal weights on `weighted` give statistical — not
strict — balance.

### Agentic pipeline mode

A two-step `pipeline` combo can opt into planner/executor routing with
`config.agenticOrchestration.enabled`. The first target owns planning and final answers;
the second target emits client-native tool calls. OmniRoute detects tool-result
continuations from the request protocol, asks the planner whether another tool round is
needed, and dynamically makes either the executor or planner the client-facing final
step.

```json
{
  "strategy": "pipeline",
  "models": [{ "model": "provider/planner" }, { "model": "provider/executor" }],
  "config": {
    "agenticOrchestration": { "enabled": true, "maxToolRounds": 8 }
  }
}
```

The executor may emit multiple independent calls in one response. Dependent calls are
handled in later client tool-result turns, with the planner reviewing every result.
`maxToolRounds` defaults to `8` and accepts `1`–`32`; once reached, the planner must
produce the best available final answer. Internal planner decisions are buffered, while
the selected client-facing response preserves the original streaming preference.

### `round-robin` sticky batch and account expansion

Round-robin is batched, not one-request-per-step:

- `stickyRoundRobinLimit` (combo config, then `comboStickyRoundRobinLimit`, then
  `settings.stickyRoundRobinLimit`, default **3**) keeps the same target for that many
  consecutive successes before rotating. Set the combo override to `1` for one-request
  rotation. The combo editor shows the effective value and which layer it came from.
- `connectionAwareExpansion` (combo config, then settings, default **false**) expands
  each provider-level step into per-account targets before rotation. Group-B strategies
  (priority, weighted, round-robin, random, p2c, least-used, cost-optimized, lkgp,
  fill-first, strict-random, context-optimized, cache-optimized, context-relay, fusion,
  pipeline) keep a provider-level view until this is on. The combo editor exposes
  inherit / on / off; inherit uses the global default (off).
- Prompt-cache locality routing (`promptCacheAffinityEnabled`, default **true**) reorders
  pinned connections so matching cache keys stay on one account. It takes precedence over
  round-robin and weighted rotation across pinned per-account steps. Turn it off under
  Settings → Combo defaults if you need strict rotation. There is no per-combo override.

For multi-account rotation on one model, prefer **one dynamic-account step** (empty
`connectionId`, whole pool) with sticky limit `1`, not three pinned `connectionId`s.
Pinned steps plus affinity collapse onto the same account even while the RR counter
advances.

## Fusion Strategy

`fusion` is the one strategy that does **not** pick a single target. It fans the prompt
out to **every panel model in parallel**, then a configurable **judge model** synthesizes
a single final answer from all panel responses. Ported from upstream `decolua/9router`
(OpenRouter's Fusion design); implementation in `open-sse/services/fusion.ts`.

How it works:

0. **Tool-bearing bypass** — a request that carries a non-empty `tools` array with
   `tool_choice` not explicitly `"none"` skips the panel entirely: it routes directly to
   a single model (the configured judge, or `panel[0]`) with `tools`/`tool_choice`
   passed through unmodified. Panel members have no tool access and the judge's
   synthesis directive discourages tool-call emission, so agentic/tool-calling clients
   get a real tool-call decision instead of synthesized prose (#6771).
1. **Fan-out** (non-tool-bearing requests only) — the prompt is sent to every panel
   model at once, forced non-streaming with tools stripped (the judge needs complete
   prose to synthesize).
2. **Quorum-grace collection** — as soon as `minPanel` answers arrive, a short grace
   timer starts for the stragglers, then fusion proceeds with whatever was collected.
   This caps the slowest model's penalty on wall time, bounded by a hard timeout.
3. **Judge synthesis** — panel answers are anonymized (`Source 1`, `Source 2`, … — so
   the judge weighs substance, not model brand) and handed to the judge, which analyzes
   consensus / contradictions / partial coverage / unique insights / blind spots, then
   writes **one** authoritative answer. The judge call keeps the client's original
   `stream` flag + tools, so streaming and downstream tool use still work.
4. **Graceful degradation** — 0 panel answers → `503`; exactly 1 survivor → that answer
   is returned directly (nothing to fuse); a single-model panel answers directly.

A panel member may also be a `combo-ref` step (`{kind: "combo-ref", comboName: "..."}`) referencing
another combo — it resolves as **one black-box panel voice** (a full recursive dispatch into the
referenced combo, not a fan-out of that combo's own targets), with the same depth/cycle protection
every other combo-ref-consuming strategy already uses (#6764).

### Configuration

Configured on the combo's `config` blob (no schema migration — it reuses the existing
`combos` table):

| Field                                    | Type     | Default           | Purpose                                                                                 |
| :--------------------------------------- | :------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config.judgeModel`                      | `string` | first panel model | Model that synthesizes the final answer                                                 |
| `config.fusionTuning.minPanel`           | `number` | `2`               | Successful answers required before the grace timer starts (clamped to `[2, panelSize]`) |
| `config.fusionTuning.stragglerGraceMs`   | `number` | `8000`            | How long to wait for laggards once quorum is reached                                    |
| `config.fusionTuning.panelHardTimeoutMs` | `number` | `90000`           | Absolute cap so one hung model can't stall the request                                  |

Defaults live in `FUSION_DEFAULTS` (`open-sse/services/fusion.ts`).

### Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:20128/api/combos \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "fusion-panel",
    "strategy": "fusion",
    "targets": [
      { "model": "cc/claude-opus-4-7" },
      { "model": "cx/gpt-5.5" },
      { "model": "glm/glm-5.1" }
    ],
    "config": {
      "judgeModel": "cc/claude-opus-4-7",
      "fusionTuning": { "minPanel": 2, "stragglerGraceMs": 8000, "panelHardTimeoutMs": 90000 }
    }
  }'
```

Then call it like any combo: `{"model":"fusion-panel","messages":[...]}`.

## Virtual Auto-Combo Factory

The Auto Combo engine doesn't require pre-defined combos. Instead, `open-sse/services/autoCombo/virtualFactory.ts` builds candidates on-the-fly:

1. Pulls `getProviderConnections({ isActive: true })` (all enabled connections)
2. Filters to those with valid credentials (API key or non-expired OAuth token via `hasUsableOAuthToken()`)
3. Cross-references with `getProviderRegistry()` for model availability + pricing
4. For each tuple `(provider, model, connection)`, builds a `VirtualAutoComboCandidate`
5. Picks `connection.defaultModel` (or the registry's first model) as the dispatch target
6. Scores each candidate using the 16-factor `scorePool()` and the variant's weight pack
7. Returns the resulting in-memory `AutoComboConfig` for `handleComboChat()` — never persisted to DB

This means **adding a new provider with `auto/*` enabled automatically expands the candidate pool** — no manual combo editing needed. The virtual combo is rebuilt per request, so newly-added or newly-healthy connections are picked up immediately.

## Self-Healing

- **Temporary exclusion**: Score < 0.2 → excluded for 5 min (progressive backoff, max 30 min)
- **Circuit breaker awareness**: OPEN → auto-excluded; HALF_OPEN → probe requests
- **Incident mode**: >50% OPEN → disable exploration, maximize stability
- **Cooldown recovery**: After exclusion, first request is a "probe" with reduced timeout

## Bandit Exploration

5% of requests (configurable) are routed to random providers for exploration. Disabled in incident mode.

## API

There is **no dedicated `POST /api/combos/auto` endpoint** — Auto-Combo is consumed in two ways:

1. **Zero-config (recommended):** Send any chat completion request with `model: "auto"` or `model: "auto/<variant>"`. The virtual factory builds the combo per request — no persistence, no API calls needed.

2. **Persisted combo with `strategy: "auto"`:** Create a regular combo via `POST /api/combos` and set `strategy: "auto"` plus `config.auto.weights` / `config.auto.candidatePool`. The same scoring engine is used; the combo is stored in `combos` and reusable by ID.

For discovery, `GET /api/combos/auto` lists every variant with its resolved candidate pool plus `context_length` / `max_output_tokens` — the MAX across the candidate pool's windows. Clients (e.g. the opencode plugin) must advertise these values instead of `0`: a zero context disables opencode's auto-compaction entirely, letting sessions grow until the gateway's history purge destroys context. MAX is safe to advertise because the auto-combo context pre-filter routes oversized requests to large-window candidates.

```bash
# Zero-config usage (no combo creation)
curl -X POST http://localhost:20128/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"auto/coding","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}]}'

# Persisted auto combo via the regular combos endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:20128/api/combos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id":"my-auto","name":"Auto Coder","strategy":"auto","config":{"auto":{"candidatePool":["anthropic","google","openai"],"weights":{"quota":0.15,"health":0.3,"costInv":0.05,"latencyInv":0.35,"taskFit":0.1,"stability":0,"tierPriority":0.05}}}}'
```

### Auto router strategies

Persisted `strategy: "auto"` combos can set `config.routerStrategy` (or legacy
`config.auto.routerStrategy`) to one of:

- `rules` — default weighted scoring
- `score` — selects the highest configured weighted score. Exact ties preserve configured
  candidate order; the existing `explorationRate` samples from the full ranked pool.
- `cost` / `eco` — cheapest healthy provider
- `latency` / `fast` — lowest p95 latency with reliability penalty
- `sla-aware` / `sla` — prefer candidates that satisfy p95 latency, error-rate, and optional
  cost SLOs
- `lkgp` — last known good provider first

### Router strategies in detail

The auto-combo engine exposes 6 pluggable **RouterStrategy** implementations that
you can swap via `config.routerStrategy` (or the legacy `config.auto.routerStrategy`).
Each strategy picks one provider from the candidate pool, given a `RoutingContext`
(task type, tool/vision hints, token estimate, optional SLA policy, optional
last-known-good provider).

#### 1. `rules` (default) — 16-factor weighted scoring

Wraps the existing scoring engine. Filters out `OPEN` circuit-breaker
candidates, then runs `scorePool()` with the current task type and `getTaskFitness()`,
picking the top-scoring provider.

```ts
class RulesStrategyImpl implements RouterStrategy {
  readonly name = "rules";
  readonly description = "16-factor weighted scoring (see DEFAULT_WEIGHTS)";

  select(pool, context) {
    const eligible = pool.filter((c) => c.circuitBreakerState !== "OPEN");
    const ranked = scorePool(
      eligible.length > 0 ? eligible : pool,
      context.taskType,
      undefined,
      getTaskFitness
    );
    return { provider: ranked[0].provider /* ... */ };
  }
}
```

**When to use**: Default. Use when you want a balanced trade-off across all signals.

**Alias**: `rules` (no alias)

---

#### 2. `cost` / `eco` — cheapest healthy provider

Sorts the candidate pool by `costPer1MTokens` (ascending) and picks the cheapest.
Filters out `OPEN` candidates first.

```ts
class CostStrategyImpl implements RouterStrategy {
  readonly name = "cost";
  readonly description = "Always selects cheapest available provider";

  select(pool, context) {
    const healthy = pool.filter((c) => c.circuitBreakerState !== "OPEN");
    const sorted = [...healthy].sort((a, b) => a.costPer1MTokens - b.costPer1MTokens);
    return { provider: sorted[0].provider /* ... */ };
  }
}
```

**When to use**: Cost-sensitive workloads, batch processing, or background jobs.

**Aliases**: `cost`, `eco`

---

#### 3. `latency` / `fast` — lowest p95 latency with reliability penalty

Sorts by `p95LatencyMs + (errorRate * 1000)`. The error-rate penalty ensures
unreliable providers are ranked lower even if their nominal latency is low.

```ts
class LatencyStrategyImpl implements RouterStrategy {
  readonly name = "latency";
  readonly description = "Prioritizes lowest p95 latency with reliability weighting";

  select(pool, context) {
    const healthy = pool.filter((c) => c.circuitBreakerState !== "OPEN");
    const sorted = [...healthy].sort(
      (a, b) => a.p95LatencyMs + a.errorRate * 1000 - (b.p95LatencyMs + b.errorRate * 1000)
    );
    return { provider: sorted[0].provider /* ... */ };
  }
}
```

**When to use**: Latency-sensitive workloads like real-time chat, autocomplete, or
interactive coding assistants.

**Aliases**: `latency`, `fast`

---

#### 4. `sla-aware` / `sla` — latency/error/cost SLO compliance

Scores each candidate by how well it satisfies the configured SLO policy:

| Factor          | Weight | Formula                                           |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Latency score   | 35%    | `threshold / max(value, ε)`                       |
| Error score     | 35%    | `threshold / max(value, ε)`                       |
| Health score    | 15%    | `1.0` (CLOSED) / `0.5` (HALF_OPEN) / `0.0` (OPEN) |
| Cost score      | 10%    | `threshold / max(value, ε)` or inverse normalized |
| Stability score | 5%     | inverse normalized latency stddev                 |

When `hardConstraints: true`, candidates are sorted primarily by **violation score**
(how far they exceed any SLO), then by composite score. Otherwise it's just
the composite score.

```ts
class SLAStrategyImpl implements RouterStrategy {
  readonly name = "sla-aware";
  readonly description =
    "Selects the provider most likely to satisfy latency, error-rate, and cost SLOs";

  select(pool, context) {
    // ... scores each candidate against policy: { targetP95Ms, maxErrorRate, maxCostPer1MTokens, hardConstraints }
  }
}
```

**SLA fields** (set on the combo config):

```json
{
  "strategy": "auto",
  "config": {
    "routerStrategy": "sla-aware",
    "slaTargetP95Ms": 1500,
    "slaMaxErrorRate": 0.05,
    "slaMaxCostPer1MTokens": 5,
    "slaHardConstraints": true
  }
}
```

**When to use**: Production workloads with strict latency, error-rate, or cost budgets.

**Aliases**: `sla-aware`, `sla`

---

#### 5. `lkgp` — last known good provider first

Tries the **last known good provider** (if set) first, then falls back to the
`rules` strategy. Useful for session stickiness — the same provider handles
follow-up requests in a conversation.

```ts
class LKGPStrategyImpl implements RouterStrategy {
  readonly name = "lkgp";
  readonly description = "Tries last known good provider first, then falls back to rules";

  select(pool, context) {
    if (context.lkgpEnabled === false) {
      return getStrategy("rules").select(pool, context);
    }

    if (context.lastKnownGoodProvider) {
      const candidates = pool.filter(
        (c) => c.provider === context.lastKnownGoodProvider && c.circuitBreakerState !== "OPEN"
      );
      if (candidates.length > 0) {
        return { provider: candidates[0].provider /* ... */ };
      }
    }

    // Fallback to rules strategy
    return getStrategy("rules").select(pool, context);
  }
}
```

**When to use**: Multi-turn conversations where you want the same provider to handle
follow-up requests (e.g., for caching, context continuity, or pricing consistency).

**Alias**: `lkgp` (no alias)

---

### Custom router strategies

You can register your own `RouterStrategy` implementation via the public API:

```ts
import {
  registerStrategy,
  type RouterStrategy,
} from "@omniroute/open-sse/services/autoCombo/routerStrategy";

class MyCustomStrategy implements RouterStrategy {
  readonly name = "my-custom";
  readonly description = "My custom routing strategy";

  select(pool, context) {
    // Your routing logic here
    return {
      provider: pool[0].provider,
      model: pool[0].model,
      strategy: this.name,
      reason: "MyCustomStrategy: ...",
      candidatesConsidered: pool.length,
      finalScore: 1.0,
    };
  }
}

registerStrategy("my-custom", new MyCustomStrategy());
```

Then use it:

```json
{
  "strategy": "auto",
  "config": {
    "routerStrategy": "my-custom"
  }
}
```

---

### Router strategy selection guide

| Use case          | Strategy    | Reason                               |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Balanced workload | `rules`     | Default — considers all factors      |
| Minimize cost     | `cost`      | Always picks cheapest                |
| Minimize latency  | `latency`   | Picks fastest reliable provider      |
| Strict SLOs       | `sla-aware` | Filters by p95/error/cost thresholds |
| Multi-turn chat   | `lkgp`      | Session stickiness                   |

SLA-aware fields:

```json
{
  "strategy": "auto",
  "config": {
    "routerStrategy": "sla-aware",
    "slaTargetP95Ms": 1500,
    "slaMaxErrorRate": 0.05,
    "slaMaxCostPer1MTokens": 5,
    "slaHardConstraints": true
  }
}
```

## Task Fitness

30+ models scored across 6 task types (`coding`, `review`, `planning`, `analysis`, `debugging`, `documentation`). Supports wildcard patterns (e.g., `*-coder` → high coding score).

## Auto Variants Recap

Including the bare `auto` (default) plus the 6 `AutoVariant` values declared in `autoPrefix.ts`, there are **7 invokable model IDs**:

`auto`, `auto/coding`, `auto/fast`, `auto/cheap`, `auto/offline`, `auto/smart`, `auto/lkgp`

(`AutoVariant` itself enumerates 6 values; the 7th option is "no variant" — bare `auto` — handled by `parseAutoPrefix()` as `variant: undefined`.)

## How tiers fit Auto-Combo

The 16-factor scoring function (`open-sse/services/autoCombo/scoring.ts`) treats tier
membership as two signals: `tierPriority` (0.0476) and `tierAffinity` (0.0476). See the
canonical [scoring factor table](#how-it-works-persisted-auto-combos) above for the full
`DEFAULT_WEIGHTS` set — the per-pack overrides (ship-fast/cost-saver/quality-first/
offline-friendly) are listed in the "Weight profiles per pack" table.

Tier alone does **not** force Tier 1 first — if Tier 1 latency is bad or
cost-vs-quality is suboptimal, Tier 2 wins. To force tier ordering, use combo
strategy `priority` and arrange providers by tier.

To strongly favor Tier 1 (subscription), increase `tierPriority` weight:

```json
{
  "strategy": "auto",
  "config": { "auto": { "weights": { "tierPriority": 0.3, "costInv": 0.05 } } }
}
```

See [`docs/guides/TIERS.md`](../guides/TIERS.md) for tier definitions and provider classification.

## Testing & Coverage

### Deterministic routing-decision matrix (`npm run test:combo:matrix`)

`tests/integration/combo-matrix/*.test.ts` proves the routing **decision** of all 19
public strategies end-to-end through the real combo pipeline with a mocked upstream.
Coverage includes:

- All 19 `ROUTING_STRATEGY_VALUES` strategies (ordered, weighted, cost, context, fusion, …).
- `quota-share` (internal) end-to-end: DRR fairness + saturation deprioritization via the
  real `selectQuotaShareTarget` seam (`registerQuotaFetcher` / `setLKGP` /
  `__setHeadroomSaturationFetcherForTests`).
- `context-relay` universal-handoff coverage across every target count.

This suite runs in CI (`test:integration` job) with `--test-concurrency=1` and
`--test-force-exit` so it is deterministic and does not require live credentials.

| `npm run test:combo:live:vps`          | HTTP calls against a live OmniRoute server (set `COMBO_LIVE_BASE_URL`)         |
| `npm run test:combo:live:vps:failover` | Same, with deliberate failover scenarios                                       |

These smoke tests exercise the real wire path (combo → provider → completion). They are
intentionally excluded from CI because they require live credentials and VPS access.
