# Free Tiers & Free-Token Budget

> **For Users**: Looking for a simple guide? See the [Free Tiers Guide](../getting-started/FREE-TIERS-GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions on getting free AI.

> **Last researched:** 2026-06-17 — per-provider web research (official docs + last-7-days news, 50-agent pass with adversarial verification) refreshing every free-tier quota + ToS. **Partial re-audit 2026-09-02** (`gemini`, `ollama-cloud`, `groq`, `nara`, `mistral` — see the dated note below).
> **Source of truth (catalog):** `open-sse/config/freeModelCatalog.ts` (per-MODEL budgets, pool-deduped). The token-budget numbers below come from live web research and are an **approximation** — see [Methodology & caveats](#methodology--caveats).

## TL;DR — how much free inference does OmniRoute actually aggregate?

These figures describe separate third-party accounts and eligibility conditions across the catalog. OmniRoute does not grant this budget: you must obtain the required accounts or credentials, connect eligible providers, and respect their limits. Actual usable capacity can be lower, including zero on a fresh installation with no eligible route. Providers marked `tos: avoid` are excluded from automatic routing by default.

**Checked 2026-10-08:** [Cerebras](https://www.cerebras.ai/pricing) offers a one-time $5 promotional credit requiring a payment method, expiring after 30 days. [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits) publishes project/model/tier rate limits; it remains outside the quantified monthly headline.

| Metric                                      | Tokens / month    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Documented recurring grant (steady)**     | **~1.62B**        | Free-tier **pools** (per-model catalog), each shared pool counted **once**. The live source behind `/api/free-tier/summary` and the dashboard's Free-Tier Budget page. **Use this number.**                                                                                      |
| **+ first month with signup credits**       | **~2.22B**        | Steady + one-time signup credits (Z.AI 20M, DeepSeek 5M, …), deduped per account. **First month only** — does not recur.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **+ permanently free, no published cap**    | _un-quantifiable_ | `siliconflow`, `glm-cn` (GLM-4-Flash), `tencent`, `baidu`, `kilo-gateway`, `opencode-zen`, `gemini`, `ollama-cloud` — real recurring access, rate/concurrency-limited, **no token cap to count**. Listed, never summed (counting them at `RPM×24/7` is the inflation we reject). |
| **+ deposit-unlock boost**                  | **+~24M**         | A one-time **$10** OpenRouter top-up raises its free pool from 50 → 1000 req/day. Reported separately so it never inflates the steady number.                                                                                                                                    |
| **+ behind a regional identity check**      | **+~6M**          | `modelscope` (Alibaba Cloud binding + mainland-China real-name verification). Real recurring quota, exposed as `gatedRecurringTokens` / `gatedProviders` and on the dashboard. Never summed into the headline: +~6M behind regional identity verification.                       |
| Theoretical ceiling (all rate limits, 24/7) | ~10B              | Sum of every provider rate limit extrapolated to non-stop use. **Not a guarantee** — do not headline this.                                                                                                                                                                       |

**Honest headline:** _OmniRoute aggregates **~1.62B documented free tokens per month** (up to ~2.22B in your first month with signup credits) across 35 free-tier pools — plus a long tail of permanently-free, no-cap providers — and RTK + Caveman compression (15–95% token savings) stretches that further._

> **Why this dropped from the previous ~1.94B.** The 2026-06-17 refresh is an honesty correction, not a loss: `gemini` is now pool-deduped (was inflated by counting each Flash variant separately, 462M → 60M), `cloudflare-ai` corrected to its real 10k-Neurons/day (122M → 30M), `doubao` reclassified as a one-time signup credit (not recurring), and shut-down tiers removed (`chutes`/`phind`/`kluster` discontinued). Partly offset by `llm7` (correct 5M/day → 150M) and new free providers (Kilo, OpenCode Zen, Z.AI GLM-Flash).
>
> **Further corrected to ~1.37B in v3.8.42:** `longcat` was reclassified from a 150M/mo recurring grant to a one-time 10M signup credit after its free preview ended. Same honesty rule — no provider was dropped by mistake.
>
> **Updated on 2026-08-26 after retiring Felo Web:** Felo Web is excluded while its GPL-derived provenance/licensing remains on HOLD; the source reported 38 pool keys at the time. The pool count is live and CI-gated (`check:docs-counts` fails the build if the numbers above drift from `computeFreeModelTotals()`).
>
> **Re-audited on 2026-09-02 against the providers' own pages** (sources: the `// evidence:` comments next to each re-audited entry in `open-sse/config/freeModelCatalog.data.ts`): `gemini` and `ollama-cloud` no longer publish a token figure (Google removed the per-model free table on 2025-12-23; Ollama's Free plan is "starter usage credits") and are now listed as **uncapped**, never summed (−80M); `groq` is five **per-model** 200K-TPD caps (6M each, +15M) with three retired IDs dropped; `nara` is one 7M/day bucket (+60M, 210M). `mistral`'s 1B is visible only in the account console — see _Evidence classes_ under Methodology.
>
> **Corrected on 2026-09-03 (#11773):** `cerebras` was reclassified from a 30M/mo recurring grant (old no-card 1M tokens/day trial) to a one-time $5 signup credit that requires a payment method. Same honesty rule as LongCat.
>
> **Plus xKiro (2026-09-03):** the new `xkiro-free` pool (150M/mo) adds a 35th recurring pool key. Felo Web stays excluded while its GPL-derived provenance/licensing remains on HOLD. The source now reports **35 recurring pool keys** and **~1.62B steady** — the live, CI-gated number (`check:docs-counts` fails the build if this drifts from `computeFreeModelTotals()`).

Biggest **documented** contributors: `mistral` 1.00B, `nara` 210M, `llm7` 150M, `xkiro` 150M, `groq` 30M (five per-model caps), `cloudflare-ai` 30M, `api-airforce` 24M. (`longcat` is excluded — its 10M LongCat-2.0 grant is a one-time, KYC-gated signup credit, not a recurring monthly budget.)

> ⚠️ The theoretical ceiling (~10B) is inflated by rate-limit-only providers with **no published token cap** (`tencent`, `siliconflow`, `nvidia`, `baidu`, `glm-cn`, `sparkdesk`) whose figures would be `RPM/TPM × 24/7 × 30d` — a theoretical maximum no single account will sustain. They are **excluded** from the defensible number (shown in the "permanently free, no cap" row instead). This is the same inflation that makes competitors' multi-billion claims unreliable.

## 2026-06-17 refresh — what changed since 2026-06-05

A 50-agent web-research pass (official docs + last-7-days news, adversarially verified) refreshed the whole catalog. Highlights:

- **Removed / no free tier (2026):** `chutes` (free tier ended 2026-03), `phind` (company shut down 2026-01), `kluster` (sunset 2026-06-09 → MITO), `gitlawb` + `gitlawb-gmi` (MiMo free revoked 2026-05-24, Nemotron promo ended 2026-06 — re-verified 2026-06-18), `aimlapi` (free tier paused — re-verified 2026-06-18), `yi` (Yi-Light retired, pay-as-you-go — re-verified 2026-06-18), `featherless-ai` (no current free tier), `chipotle` (Chipotle's "Pepper AI" — the reverse-engineered `amelia.chipotle.com` Amelia chat widget the provider talked to now 404s on every route, including root; decommissioned/moved backend, confirmed 2026-09-15 — fully removed from the catalog, #13131/#4037). `iflytek` / `sparkdesk` stay listed but carry a ToS-caution note (Spark Lite is free; the ToS restricts proxy/relay use).
- **Gemini** — `2.0 Flash` / `2.0 Flash-Lite` shut down 2026-06-01 and `2.5 Pro` left the free tier (2026-04); free tier is now **Flash-family only** (2.5/3/3.1/3.5 Flash + Gemma). The catalog now **pools** the Flash family (was inflated by counting each variant separately: 462M → 60M).
- **Corrected numbers:** `cloudflare-ai` 122M → **30M** (real 10k-Neurons/day), `doubao` reclassified as a one-time signup credit (not recurring), `llm7` 4M → **150M** (documented 5M tokens/day), `together` "-Free" endpoints discontinued → $25 signup credit also removed (requires $5 minimum purchase, no free trial), `longcat` Preview ended + Flash models retired → **LongCat-2.0** only, reclassified as a one-time **10M**-token signup credit (KYC-gated, not recurring).
- **New free providers discovered:** ⭐ **Kilo Code** (`kilo-gateway` — rotating "Auto Free" set: NVIDIA Nemotron 3 family, StepFun, Poolside, Nex-N2-Pro), ⭐ **OpenCode Zen** (`opencode-zen` — 6 rotating free coding models), ⭐ **Z.AI / Zhipu** (`glm-cn` — GLM-4-Flash / 4.5-Flash / 4.7-Flash permanently free + 20M signup bonus), and `arcee-ai` Trinity Large Preview.
- **New honest tiers** (see Methodology): a _permanently-free-but-uncapped_ category (real recurring access, no token cap to count) and a _deposit-unlock boost_ (OpenRouter $10 → +24M/mo), both surfaced **separately** so they never inflate the headline.

> The detailed per-provider table further down is the **2026-06-05 snapshot**; the deltas above supersede it. The live, canonical source is the per-model catalog `open-sse/config/freeModelCatalog.ts`.

## Two regimes — counting vs deciding

OmniRoute answers "is it free?" through two regimes that intentionally read
different sources:

| Regime                    | Source of truth                                                                                                                                                        | Surfaces                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Counting / displaying** | Resolved catalog — the shipped baseline overlaid by the Radar feed (`getRadarCatalog`)                                                                                 | Free-tier totals, budget card, dashboards                                                                                      |
| **Deciding**              | Shipped catalog only (`FREE_MODEL_BUDGETS` in `open-sse/config/freeModelCatalog.data.ts`) plus the local heuristics (`:free` suffix, zero pricing, `grantsFreeAccess`) | Every consumer of `src/shared/utils/freeModels.ts`: model import, `auto/*` routing, `GET /v1/models`, and the browser previews |

Counting can improve whenever a feed is available. Deciding stays on the
release artifact, so the answer is identical in the browser and on the server,
reproducible offline, and testable without a database. Letting the browser
preview read one source while the server import reads another would produce a
preview that disagrees with what happens on click — the split is kept on
purpose.

## Methodology & caveats

- Numbers are **upper-bound estimates** from each provider's documented free-tier limits as of **2026-06-17**, gathered by web research. Free tiers change constantly — re-verify before relying on a figure.
- **What an entry actually vouches for.** No entry carries a per-row confidence rating, and the API serves none — treat every figure above as an estimate of the same, unstated quality. Two facts are different, because they are curated by hand rather than inferred: 44 entries carry an independently documented hard stop (39 of them the xKiro rows, which all share one daily allowance), and 13 entries carry a prompt-training disclosure. `hardStopGuaranteed` is set only when the provider's own terms say that exceeding the free allowance refuses the request rather than silently starting to bill you, with the source in a comment next to the entry; it is never defaulted to `true`, and an entry nobody has verified stays unset. So a missing hard-stop flag means "not established", not "known to bill you". **STRICT mode** (the opt-in `freeAccessPolicy=strict` routing guard) only trusts entries that carry the flag; every other free tier is excluded as `no-hard-stop` (see `open-sse/services/autoCombo/strictZeroCostFilter.ts`). When the guard filters a pool, the operator-visible log reports both the exclusion count and its `no-hard-stop` share.
- `estMonthlyFreeTokens` = recurring monthly tokens only. **One-time signup credits do not recur** and count as 0. Discontinued tiers are also 0.
- Daily token cap → `monthly = daily × 30`. Only RPD documented → `RPD × ~800 output tokens × 30`. Only RPM/TPM (no daily cap) → **uncapped** (see below).
- **Permanently free, but no published token cap** (`siliconflow`, `glm-cn`, `tencent`, `baidu`, `kilo-gateway`, `opencode-zen`, `gemini`, `ollama-cloud`): these are real recurring free access, rate/concurrency-limited. We classify them `recurring-uncapped` and **never sum them** — multiplying `RPM × 24/7 × 30d` would produce a fantasy ceiling (the inflation we reject). They are listed so you know they exist.
- **Deposit-unlock boost:** a one-time small top-up that permanently raises a free quota (OpenRouter: $10 → 1000 req/day ≈ +24M/mo). Reported as a separate figure, kept out of the steady headline.
- **Eligibility-gated quotas** (`eligibilityGate: "regional-identity"`): a real recurring quota that only opens after a region-bound identity check (mainland-China real-name verification today). Counted with the same pool-dedupe rule into a separate figure (`gatedRecurringTokens`), never into the steady headline. The regime (`freeType`) is unchanged, so routing is unchanged.
- **Evidence classes.** The rule: a number in the catalog cites its source in an `// evidence:` comment next to the entry — `public-page` (a provider page anyone can read), `api-public` (an unauthenticated endpoint of the provider, e.g. NaraRouter's public plans endpoint at router.bynara.id), or `console-verified <date> por <who>` (the figure is only visible inside an account console; the comment records who saw it and when, and the public page that says the cap exists). The state today: the five blocks re-audited on 2026-09-02 carry it (`gemini`, `groq`, `mistral`, `ollama-cloud`, `nara`); entries that predate the 2026-09-02 re-audit inherit the earlier research until they are touched; any **new or changed** number without an evidence comment is a bug. Today only `mistral` is console-verified.

---

## Why our number is smaller than other aggregators'

Most "free tokens per month" figures in this space are sums of per-model labels. Ours is not, on purpose:

- **Each shared pool is counted once.** Mistral's free plan is one 1B/month allowance per organization; listing it under five models does not make it 5B. Summed per model, our own catalog would read **~7.4B** (recomputed on 2026-09-03; this figure is not CI-gated — re-measure it whenever the catalog changes) — the headline says **~1.47B** because that is what one account of each provider can actually spend.
- **Daily caps are converted, rates are not.** A documented tokens/day cap becomes `× 30`; a documented requests/day cap becomes `RPD × ~800 tokens × 30`; a provider that only publishes requests-per-minute has **no** monthly figure and is listed as _uncapped_, never summed. Multiplying a rate limit by 24/7 is the inflation we refuse.
- **Quotas behind a regional identity check are shown apart** (`+~6M behind regional identity verification`), because most readers cannot use them.
- **Signup credits are first-month only** and reported as a second figure, never blended into the steady number.
- **The figure is enforced by CI.** `npm run check:docs-counts` recomputes the totals from the catalog and fails the build when this file, the README or the budget card drift from them.

## ToS attention table

> **ToS flag is advisory, not a routing gate.** Providers marked `tos` are still included in routing and combo/fallback by default; the flag only surfaces on `/dashboard/free-tiers` and `/api/free-tier/summary`. The `excludeTosAvoid` query parameter affects the summary view only, not global routing. The verdict lives in `open-sse/config/freeTierCatalog.ts` (informational, not read by routing engines).

> A quick read on each provider's terms for a self-hosted, single-user personal proxy. `caution` = a personal-use or proxy clause worth checking; `ambiguous` = unclear; `ok` = explicitly permitted. Informational, not legal advice — you decide.

### ⚠️ Caution — personal-use / proxy clauses worth checking (16)

> Their free access is real and OmniRoute can route to them; the clauses below are just worth knowing. The OAuth/keyless ones aren't token-quantifiable, so they're not in the headline number (not because they're unusable).

## Per-provider free-tier (refreshed 2026-09-02 for the re-audited rows; 2026-06-17 otherwise)

> Regenerated from the per-model catalog (`open-sse/config/freeModelCatalog.ts`), pool-deduped. Sorted by recurring steady tokens/mo. `uncapped*` = permanently free but no published token cap (rate/concurrency-limited) — real access, **not** summed into the headline. `—` = credit-only / keyless / not token-quantifiable.

## OpenCode Free: client-contract restriction (#14313)

The keyless `opencode` provider (public `https://opencode.ai/zen/v1`) refuses any request
that does not match the OpenCode client contract with **403 `FreeTierError`** and the
sentence _"OpenCode's free tier can only be used from within OpenCode"_. This is a
request-scoped refusal (same verdict on every account for the same request shape), not a
model ban or connection cooldown — OmniRoute classifies it as `project_route_error`, skips
model lockout / cooldown, and (on the synthetic `noauth` path) pauses auto-combo re-selection
for a short TTL. Ship requests that carry a non-empty tool list, `stream: true`, and the
OpenCode session/UA headers (`opencodeFreeTierContract.ts`) or expect the 403.

## What changed since the shipped catalog (`freeNote`)

> The v3.8.0-era `freeNote` strings are stale. Corrections found by this research (these drive the catalog update in `_tasks/features-v3.8.12`):

- **`360ai`** — The shipped freeNote "Free 360 AI Brain models" appears outdated. Current access is application-gated and paid. The 2023 launch-era promotional tokens (100M–250M one-time) may have been the basis for…
- **`agentrouter`** — Our shipped freeNote says "$200 free credits on signup." Current reality shows standard (non-referral) signups receive only $100; referral signups may get $200 but a community comment from April 2026…
- **`agy`** — Our shipped freeNote says "(none)" implying no free tier, but Antigravity does have a free OAuth-gated tier. However, the ToS explicitly prohibits using this free tier through a proxy like OmniRoute …
- **`ai21`** — Tightened: trial window shrunk from "3 months" to 7 days. The $10 credit amount remains the same, but validity dropped sharply from ~90 days to 7 days.
- **`aimlapi`** — Changed significantly. Shipped freeNote advertised "$0.025/day free credits — 200+ models" but the free tier is now paused/discontinued. The $0.025/day credit allocation (50,000 credits/day, 10 req/d…
- **`amazon-q`** — Our shipped freeNote says "(none)" — the reality is worse: the product is now discontinued for new signups (May 15, 2026). Previously the free tier offered 50 agentic requests/month + unlimited inlin…
- **`api-airforce`** — Catalog ships freeNote "(none)" but a documented free tier exists: 1 RPM / 1,000 RPD recurring, account signup required, limited to basic models.
- **`arcee-ai`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free Trinity Large Thinking model (262K context)") is partially accurate — Trinity Large Thinking is indeed free via OpenRouter with 262K context — but the note omits that this…
- **`baichuan`** — Our shipped freeNote says "Free Baichuan models" which implies ongoing free access, but current reality is only a one-time 80 CNY trial credit for new users (valid 3 months). There are no permanently…
- **`baidu`** — The catalog says "Free ERNIE Speed/Lite models" which is broadly accurate, but understates the scope: ERNIE-Tiny and multiple context-window variants (8K and 128K) are also free. The free tier appear…
- **`bazaarlink`** — Broadly matches — the shipped freeNote accurately describes auto:free routing for zero-cost inference. However, the current reality includes explicit rate limits (10-20 RPM, ~150 RPD) not mentioned i…
- **`blackbox`** — Our shipped freeNote claims "unlimited basic chat plus Minimax-M2.5." In reality, unlimited Minimax-M2.5 agent requests are a paid-plan feature (Pro+), not part of the free tier. The free tier has li…
- **`bluesminds`** — Our shipped freeNote was "(none)" — but BluesMinds does have a documented free tier: 500 pi credits, 20 RPM, 300 RPD, permanent free plan. The catalog significantly understates the offering.
- **`brave-search`** — The catalog notes "(none)" suggesting no free tier was tracked, but in reality there was a free 5,000 queries/month tier (no card) until February 12, 2026, which has since been replaced by a $5/month…
- **`byteplus`** — Our catalog shipped "(none)" but BytePlus ModelArk does have a free tier: a one-time trial credit of 500k tokens per LLM model for new accounts. The catalog underreports this.
- **`cerebras`** — The no-card 1M tokens/day trial is gone. Live cerebras.ai/pricing (2026-09-03) is a one-time $5 signup credit, payment method required, 30-day validity. Reclassified as `one-time-initial` (LongCat-shaped); dropped from `LEGACY_FREE_PROVIDERS` and the recurring budget.
- **`chutes`** — The shipped freeNote says "Free tier available" but as of March 15, 2026, the free tier has been officially discontinued. The catalog note is stale and should be updated to reflect that there is no r…
- **`coze`** — The shipped note "Free ByteDance agent platform" is directionally accurate but omits that the free tier is now tightly credit-capped (10 credits/day ≈ 5–100 messages depending on model), a constraint…
- **`deepinfra`** — Our shipped freeNote says "Free signup credits for API testing" — this appears stale. The official pricing page now requires card/prepayment with no documented general free signup credit. The free ti…
- **`deepseek`** — Our shipped note says "5M free tokens on signup - no credit card required" — this is still accurate for the one-time grant, but importantly the credits expire after 30 days (not mentioned in the ship…
- **`dify`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free open-source AI app builder + RAG") is directionally accurate but incomplete. The cloud free tier is more constrained than implied: 200 message credits appear to be a one-t…
- **`doubao`** — The shipped freeNote "Free Doubao models (ByteDance)" is directionally correct but underspecified. Current reality is more structured: there is a quantified recurring daily free tier (2M tokens/day v…
- **`duckduckgo-web`** — The core "free anonymous access" description still holds, but the service has matured significantly: it now has explicit paid tiers (Plus/Pro) with higher limits implying the free tier is rate-constr…
- **`exa-search`** — Catalog ships freeNote "(none)" but Exa has a documented recurring free tier of 1,000 requests/month. This is a significant gap — the free tier exists and is permanent.
- **`featherless-ai`** — Our shipped freeNote says "Free tier available" but there is no general free tier. The only free access is through an invitation/application-based Builder Series program, which is not a standard free…
- **`firecrawl`** — Our catalog shipped freeNote "(none)", implying no free tier. In reality Firecrawl has a documented recurring free plan with 1,000 credits/month — the catalog entry is incorrect.
- **`freemodel-dev`** — Our shipped freeNote is "(none)" — this was likely a placeholder meaning the provider was not yet cataloged. In reality the provider does have a $300 one-time trial credit offer. However, this is a o…
- **`friendliai`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free tier for serverless inference") is partially accurate but misleading. There is free access via Tier 0 and free-designated models, but the rate limits are undefined and ada…
- **`gemini`** — The shipped freeNote says "1,500 req/day for Gemini 2.5 Flash" — this was accurate before December 2025. Google cut free-tier limits by 50-80% in December 2025, reducing Gemini 2.5 Flash from 1,500 R…
- **`gitlawb`** — The shipped freeNote "Free tier available" is effectively stale. The original free MiMo access was removed in May 2026; the only remaining "free" option is a temporary promotional model (Nemotron 3 U…
- **`gitlawb-gmi`** — Partially still accurate — free tier exists but is now narrowed to a single model (Nemotron 3 Ultra) after MiMo free access was revoked in late May 2026. The shipped note "Free tier available" unders…
- **`groq`** — The shipped freeNote "30 RPM / 14.4K RPD" is accurate only for llama-3.1-8b-instant. Most other models (including llama-3.3-70b-versatile) have a much lower 1K RPD cap. The note omits model-specific … **Resolved 2026-09-02:** the `freeNote` now reads "Free plan: per-model caps (200K tokens/day per chat model; see console.groq.com/docs/rate-limits for RPM/RPD) — no payment method on file." and the catalog carries five per-model 6M caps (llama-3.3-70b-versatile retired from the free tier on 2026-08-16) — see the [2026-09-02 re-audit note](#tldr--how-much-free-inference-does-omniroute-actually-aggregate).
- **`huggingchat`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free LLM chat — no subscription required. Rate limits apply.") is partially accurate but significantly understates the restrictions. The free tier now operates on a hard $0.10/…
- **`huggingface`** — Significantly tightened. The shipped freeNote ("Free Inference API for thousands of models") implied unlimited/generous free access, but as of mid-2025 the free tier is capped at $0.10/month in recur…
- **`hyperbolic`** — Our shipped freeNote says "$1-5 trial credits on signup" — the $1 trial credit portion is accurate, but the "$5" figure refers to the minimum deposit required to unlock GPU rental (not free credits g…
- **`iflytek`** — Catalog says "Free Spark Lite models" — this is broadly accurate. However the current reality is more nuanced: only Spark Lite is free (the Max 100M token offer was a one-time promo, not recurring); …
- **`inference-net`** — The shipped freeNote states "$25 free credits on signup plus research grants." The current pricing page shows only $1 recurring monthly credits with no mention of a $25 signup bonus or research grant…
- **`jina-reader`** — Our shipped freeNote was "(none)", which is incorrect. Jina Reader has had a publicly documented free tier since launch: keyless access at 20 RPM plus a 10M one-time token grant with a free API key. …
- **`kiro`** — Catalog shipped freeNote "(none)" — but Kiro has a documented, perpetual free tier of 50 credits/month. The free tier existed since Kiro's public launch (pricing formalized ~October 2025). This is a …
- **`llm7`** — Rate limits have increased from the shipped freeNote (20 RPM / 100 req/hr → 40 RPM / 200 req/hr). The "no signup required" claim is now outdated — a free token from token.llm7.io is now required (tho…
- **`longcat`** — The public preview/beta ended and the Flash models were retired; only the GA `LongCat-2.0` remains. The free tier is a **one-time 10M-token grant** unlocked after account signup + **KYC verification** — it does **not** reset daily or monthly. Beyond the grant it is pay-as-you-go.
- **`mistral`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free Experiment tier: rate-limited access to all models") is directionally correct but understated. Current reality adds specific documented limits: 2 RPM, 500K TPM, 1B tokens/…
- **`monsterapi`** — The shipped freeNote says "Free credits for decentralized GPU inference" which is partially accurate — there are one-time trial credits on signup. However, the recurring free tier has 0 credits/month…
- **`morph`** — The shipped freeNote mentions "250K credits/month" which matches the current credit allocation; however, the more significant constraint is 200 requests/month which was not captured in the original c…
- **`muse-spark-web`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free with login — Meta AI platform with Llama models") is broadly accurate regarding login requirement and Llama model access. No tightening of the free tier was detected; it r…
- **`nlpcloud`** — The shipped freeNote says "Trial credits for new accounts," which implies a one-time trial. In reality, NLP Cloud's free tier is a recurring monthly free plan (10,000 requests/month), not trial credi…
- **`nomic`** — Our shipped freeNote says "Free Nomic Embed API" with no qualification, implying ongoing free access. Reality is a one-time 1M-token trial credit only — after that token budget is consumed, paid subs…
- **`nous-research`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free tier: 50 RPM, 500,000 TPM") does not match the current Nous Portal product. The portal launched April 27, 2026 and structures its free tier as $0.10/month in recurring cre…
- **`nvidia`** — The "40 RPM, 70+ models" rate limit element matches the catalog, but the freeNote framing as a simple dev-access tier undersells that the old one-time credit pool has been removed — access is now tru…
- **`ollama-cloud`** — Our shipped freeNote is "(none)" — this is stale. Ollama Cloud launched a cloud inference product with a genuine free tier that provides light weekly GPU-time-based access to hosted open models.
- **`openrouter`** — RPD tightened from 200 to 50 for zero-credit accounts (RPM unchanged at 20). The catalog note was accurate on RPM but overstated the RPD by 4x for the no-credits baseline tier. **Runtime tracking (#6842)**: this is no longer just a static note — `open-sse/services/openrouterQuotaFetcher.ts` polls `/api/v1/key` + `/api/v1/credits` for per-key credit cap/remaining/reset and daily/weekly/monthly USD spend, and `open-sse/services/openrouterFreeWindow.ts` locally tracks the `:free`-model 50-or-1000-per-day + 20 RPM windows described above (corrected from `X-RateLimit-*` response headers on 429s), surfaced in Dashboard → Provider Quota.
- **`phind`** — Phind shut down on January 16, 2026. The provider has now been **fully removed** from the catalog (registry, executor, and both the web-cookie and API-key catalog entries) — matching the dead-service-removal precedent (#5246 Gemini CLI).
- **`pollinations`** — Partially matches — the "no API key required" claim is still true for anonymous access, but the catalog freeNote omits that: (1) rate limits do apply (interval throttle of ~1 req/6-15s for anonymous …
- **`predibase`** — The shipped freeNote ($25 free trial credits, 30-day validity) still matches current documentation. However, the catalog omits the concurrent 20,000 tokens/day serverless rate limit that applies duri…
- **`publicai`** — The shipped freeNote ("Free community inference tier") is broadly accurate but understates the specificity: the 20 RPM rate limit is now documented. No major tightening found; the service remains fre…
- **`puter`** — **Fully removed** from the catalog (registry, executor, free-model catalog and API-key entry) at the request of Puter's owner (Nariman Jelveh) — see the dead-service-removal precedent above (`phind`).
- **`qoder`** — Our catalog ships freeNote "(none)", but Qoder does have a free tier: a Community Edition with unlimited basic-model completions (daily-capped, unspecified limit) plus a one-time 14-day/300-credit Pr…
- **`sambanova`** — Our shipped note only described the one-time $5 credit (30-day validity). The current reality includes a permanent recurring free tier with documented rate limits (20 RPM, 20 RPD, 200k TPD) that pers…
- **`sensenova`** — Our shipped freeNote says "Free SenseTime models" which is vague but directionally correct — free access does exist. However, reality is more nuanced: free access is a time-limited public beta (Token…
- **`serper-search`** — The shipped freeNote says "(none)" which is partially accurate — there is no recurring free plan — but Serper does offer 2,500 one-time trial credits on signup. The catalog note could be more precise…
- **`siliconflow`** — Partially matches but more nuanced: the $1 free credits are a one-time trial (not recurring), while the "permanently free models" component still holds — free $0 models continue to exist (Qwen3-8B, D…
- **`sparkdesk`** — Partially matches — the shipped freeNote "Free iFlytek Spark models" is accurate in that Spark Lite is permanently free, but understates the constraint (2 QPS per App ID) and overstates scope (only S…
- **`stepfun`** — The shipped freeNote "Free Step-2 models" is stale. Step-2 LLM free access is no longer offered; the platform has transitioned to Step 3.x models on a paid-per-token basis with no free LLM tier. Only…
- **`t3-web`** — The shipped freeNote is broadly accurate (limited model access, Pro unlocks 50+ models for $8/month), but misses two key updates: (1) the free tier now resets daily instead of monthly (changed around…
- **`tavily-search`** — Catalog ships freeNote "(none)" implying no free tier, but Tavily does in fact offer a documented recurring free tier of 1,000 credits/month with no credit card required. This is a significant discre…
- **`tencent`** — Largely matches — the shipped freeNote ("Free Hunyuan Lite models") is accurate. Hunyuan-lite has been permanently free since May 2024 and remains so as of 2026. The catalog note undersells the detai…
- **`together`** — The shipped note says "$25 signup credits + 3 permanently free models" but Together now requires a minimum $5 credit purchase and offers no free trial. The $25 signup credit was removed from the catalog (#12526). The provider still hosts ~80 permanently free models but the ToS (Section 4.3(d)) explicitly prohibits transferring, distributing, reselling, or offering the Services.
- **`uncloseai`** — Largely matches — still free forever with no signup. However, the ToS (terms-of-use.html) clarifies IP-based throttling exists for excessive use and prohibits building competing ML services without a…
- **`veoaifree-web`** — The shipped freeNote states "6 requests/hour" but no such explicit limit is currently documented anywhere on veoaifree.com. The site claims unlimited free generation with no login. The models listed …
- **`voyage-ai`** — The shipped freeNote "200M free tokens for embeddings and reranking" is directionally correct on the token count but misleading — it omits that this is a one-time per-account allocation, not a recurr…
- **`yi`** — The shipped freeNote "Free Yi-Light models" references a model name ("Yi-Light") that does not appear in any current 01.AI documentation or model catalog — no such model is listed on platform.01.ai, …
