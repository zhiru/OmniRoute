# CLI Machine-ID Token

## Overview

OmniRoute CLI commands authenticate against the local management API using a
`HMAC-SHA256(machine-id, salt)` token sent via the `x-omniroute-cli-token`
request header.

This allows CLI subcommands (`omniroute status`, `omniroute providers`, etc.)
to call management endpoints without requiring the user to supply a JWT or
password on every invocation.

## How it works

1. `getMachineTokenSync()` reads the hardware machine ID via `node-machine-id`
   (falls back to an empty string on failure, disabling CLI auth).
2. It computes `HMAC-SHA256(machine_id, salt)` and returns the full 64-char
   hex digest — a deterministic, non-reversible token tied to this machine.
3. The CLI sends the token as `x-omniroute-cli-token` only when the resolved
   destination is an explicit loopback URL (`localhost`, `127.0.0.0/8`, or
   loopback IPv6). Requests carrying the token use `redirect: error`, so a local
   redirect cannot forward it to another origin. Remote contexts use scoped
   access tokens instead. If derivation is unavailable, the CLI omits the header
   and `omniroute doctor` reports the failure instead of treating an empty token
   as valid.
4. The server (`src/server/authz/policies/management.ts`) recomputes the
   expected token with the same salt and compares via `timingSafeEqual` to
   prevent timing-based extraction.

## Security properties

| Property                         | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loopback-only**                | Accepted only when the server's trusted peer-locality stamp (derived from the real TCP peer address) says loopback. The client-controlled `Host` header is never trusted for locality. |
| **Constant-time compare**        | `crypto.timingSafeEqual` prevents timing attacks.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Non-reversible**               | HMAC output cannot recover the machine-id.                                                                                                                                             |
| **No `always`-protected bypass** | `isAlwaysProtectedPath()` is evaluated before the CLI token check. `/api/shutdown` and `/api/settings/database` always require JWT.                                                    |
| **Non-exportable**               | Token is never written to disk or logged.                                                                                                                                              |

## Default salt (random per install)

When `OMNIROUTE_CLI_SALT` is not set, the salt is a random 64-char hex string
generated once and persisted at `<DATA_DIR>/cli-token-salt.json` (mode `0600`) —
not the checked-in literal `omniroute-cli-auth-v1`. Both `getActiveSalt()` in
`src/lib/machineToken.ts` and its mirror in `bin/cli/utils/cliToken.mjs` read the
same file, so the server and every CLI invocation on this install converge on the
same value; the checked-in literal is used only as a last-resort fallback when no
persisted or env salt can be established yet (for example a fresh CLI-only install
before the server has ever run). This closes a weakness of the old fixed literal
default: `/etc/machine-id` is commonly world-readable, so any local user could
otherwise derive the same token for every install that never set
`OMNIROUTE_CLI_SALT`.

If the salt cannot be read or created, both the server and CLI emit one warning
per process before using that compatibility fallback. The warning contains no
salt, token, filesystem path or raw error. Restore access to `DATA_DIR` or set
`OMNIROUTE_CLI_SALT`, then restart the affected process. The warning makes the
failure visible; it does not make the public fallback salt private or disable
CLI authentication. Existing valid persisted salts and explicit environment
overrides retain their previous token values.

## Salt rotation

Set `OMNIROUTE_CLI_SALT` to rotate the derived token without code changes — it
always takes priority over the persisted per-install salt. After rotation, all CLI
processes on this machine will use the new token automatically. Useful after a
process-list leak that may have exposed the previous derived value.

```bash
# Persistent rotation (add to shell profile)
export OMNIROUTE_CLI_SALT="my-secret-salt-2026"

# Verify new token is in use
omniroute status
```

## Legacy format (SHA-256, 32-char) — still accepted

Before the HMAC format above, the CLI derived its token as
`SHA-256(machineId + salt).hex[0..32]` (a 32-char prefix) in
`bin/cli/utils/cliToken.mjs` (`getLegacyCliTokenSync` in `src/lib/machineToken.ts`).

For backwards compatibility the server accepts **both** formats: the verifier builds
`expectedTokens = [getMachineTokenSync(), getLegacyCliTokenSync()]` and compares the
incoming header against each with `timingSafeEqual`
(`src/server/authz/policies/management.ts` and `src/lib/middleware/cliTokenAuth.ts`).
So a token is valid if it matches **either** the 64-char HMAC digest or the 32-char
legacy SHA-256 prefix.

**Opt-out:** set `OMNIROUTE_DISABLE_CLI_TOKEN=true` (env or `.env`) to disable the CLI
token mechanism entirely; all access then requires an explicit API key. On multi-user
hosts this is recommended, since `machine-id` is per-device (not per-user) and another
user on the same host could compute the same token.
