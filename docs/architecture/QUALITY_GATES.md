# Quality Gates Reference

This document is the authoritative reference for all CI quality gates in OmniRoute.
It describes each gate, what it validates, which CI job it runs in, whether it uses
a ratchet baseline or a pass/fail policy, and whether it blocks the build or is advisory.

For a short summary and the allowlist policy, see the "Quality Gates & Ratchets" section
in `AGENTS.md`. For the critical assessment, maturity classification, and tool-agnostic
replication plan of the same system, see the
[Quality Gate Playbook](../ops/QUALITY_GATE_PLAYBOOK.md).

## Gate inventory and execution profiles

### Candidate admission

The CI and Quality Gates workflows each emit a stable verdict: `Gate / CI` and
`Gate / Quality`. Their versioned admission policy enumerates every upstream job
as required or advisory. An applicable required job must succeed: missing,
cancelled, skipped, pending and unknown results cannot establish PASS. A valid
docs-only or catalog-only classification can make a code lane inapplicable;
a draft PR is not an accepted candidate. A `hotfix` label does not waive evidence.

Both workflows cover PRs and pushes to main/release branches, manual dispatch and
merge-group events. Push, dispatch and merge-group run the full selection. Forks
and merge groups use hosted runners for jobs that otherwise select self-hosted
runners; sufficient hosted capacity must be verified before rollout.

Each JSON receipt identifies the checked-out SHA, workflow run and attempt.
The CLI rejects a checkout/event SHA mismatch. Workflow tests bind policy membership
to the verdict job's `needs` list so a new or removed lane cannot silently disappear.
The receipts cover their own workflow, not publication, deployment, or the internals
of an existing advisory scanner. Activating both check names in branch rules is a
separate administrative change; adding these jobs does not itself protect a branch.

### Static scan inventory

The versioned npm-alias inventory and static-scan membership live in
`config/quality/gate-manifest.json`. Run `npm run check:gate-manifest` to validate
script names and exact commands against `package.json`; additions, removals and
command drift fail both the local hook and the change-classification jobs in CI.
An alias is not a workflow job, matrix instance or test case: these counts must
not be presented as interchangeable.

Use `npm run quality:scan -- --list` or `npm run quality:scan:fast -- --list`
to inspect the selected aliases without executing them. The runner invokes the
npm entrypoint, so its runtime (including Bun where configured) is preserved.
The manifest records aliases outside those profiles as separately invoked, and
maintenance commands are forbidden in read-only scan profiles.

These profiles cover the static scan only. They do not certify product tests,
coverage, packaging, external checks or a candidate's full release acceptance.
Workflow admission uses the linked `config/quality/admission-policy.json` and
`scripts/quality/admission-verdict.mjs`. Release-observer profiles remain separate;
inspect their applicable checks and receipts independently. The prose
inventory below is a reference, not proof that a gate actually ran.

Scripts live under `scripts/check/` (policy gates) and `scripts/quality/` (ratchet engine).
The CI source of truth is `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### Release PR fast-path (`quality.yml`)

`.github/workflows/quality.yml` complements CI on main/release PRs, protected-branch
pushes, dispatch and merge groups. PRs use path-filtered fast checks. The permanently
disabled duplicate build was removed; the real build/package/boot checks remain in CI.

#### Forgotten sibling tests report

`npm run check:forgotten-sibling-tests` reuses the import resolver behind the test-impact map.
For every changed production module, it reports deterministic
`changed module/symbol -> static consumer -> candidate sibling test` chains when the candidate
test is absent from the pull-request diff. The Markdown summary and JSON result are retained as
the `forgotten-sibling-tests` workflow artifact for calibration before any blocking rollout.

Barrel re-exports and dynamic imports are resolution diagnostics only; they never create a
blocking finding. Reviewed exceptions live in
`config/quality/forgotten-sibling-allowlist.json`. Each entry must name the consumer and candidate
test, give a specific rationale, and link a GitHub issue or pull request. Malformed entries fail
closed. Exceptions cannot suppress a deleted candidate test or a diff that adds `.skip`/`.todo`;
assertion weakening and other masking remain owned by the independently blocking
`check:test-masking` gate.

### Job: `lint`

Runs on every PR to `main`. Blocks merge on failure.

| `check:dashboard-typecheck`       | `tsc` scoped to `src/app/(dashboard)/**` (#7033) — `typecheck:core`'s curated 27-file allowlist does not include any dashboard TSX, and `next build` never type-checks it either (`next.config.mjs` sets `ignoreBuildErrors: true`), so orphaned-identifier regressions there (#6625/#6909) were invisible to CI. Diffs against a frozen per-file/per-TS-code count baseline (`config/quality/dashboard-typecheck-baseline.json`, same stale-enforcement pattern as `check:known-symbols`) — only NEW errors beyond the baselined count fail the gate; ratchet down with `--update` when a pre-existing error is fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                           | Yes                                      |

real; the external scanners install via `gh release download` and self-skip (exit 0)
when a binary is still absent.

Needs `fetch-depth: 0` — the value-drift gate diffs `en.json` against the merge base.

#### `check-ui-value-drift` — stale-translation gate

Catches the one i18n regression the other gates structurally cannot see: an English value
is rewritten and the translations derived from the _previous_ English stay behind, so
non-English users keep reading confidently-worded, now-wrong copy.

This shipped for real. `oauthModal.googleOAuthWarning` was rewritten when the Antigravity
login helper landed (#5203); **39 of 43 locales** kept text telling operators to "copy the
full URL and paste it below" — a flow that cannot complete for that provider. It went
unnoticed until #8463 because:

- `sync-ui-keys` only backfills keys that are **absent**, never ones that are **stale**;
- `check-ui-keys-coverage` counts key _presence_, so a stale translation scores as covered;
- `check-translation-drift` tracks the `docs/i18n/<locale>/**.md` documentation mirrors —
  it never reads `src/i18n/messages/*.json`. Blocking in job `docs-sync-strict` since the
  2026-09 re-sync: edit a core doc → `npm run i18n:run -- --files=<doc>` (section-level, cheap).

**Diff-aware, not baseline-backed.** It compares `en.json` at the merge base against the
working tree; for every key whose English value changed, any locale still holding an
untouched translation is stale. This deliberately **freezes pre-existing debt** — a diff
cannot reveal which old English a long-standing translation came from, so the gate judges
only what the current change touches. The alternative (a per-key hash baseline) would cost
a ~600 KB generated file, 3× the largest existing baseline, churning on every i18n PR.

Two ways to satisfy it:

1. update the affected translations, or
2. set them to `__MISSING__:<new english>` — the runtime then serves the corrected English
   (`src/i18n/request.ts::deepMergeFallback`, #7258) and the key queues for translation.

If the string's **meaning** changed, prefer **renaming the key**: a new key cannot inherit
a stale translation. That is the pattern #8463 used.

```bash
npm run i18n:check-value-drift          # strict (what CI runs)
npm run i18n:check-value-drift:warn     # report only
BASE_REF=origin/release/vX.Y.Z npm run i18n:check-value-drift
```

Exits 0 with `SKIP reason=base-unresolved` when the base catalog cannot be read (shallow
clone without the base ref), mirroring `check-openapi-breaking`.

## Velocity phase (2026-08-30 → v4.0 LTS): every baseline loosened by 20%

Owner decision (2026-08-30): until the v4.0 modularization, shipping speed matters more
than holding the debt line. Every **numeric** ratchet baseline was loosened by 20% in one
auditable pass, and the phase is declared in `config/quality/quality-baseline.json`:

Allowlists (`eslint-suppressions.json`, `test-masking-allowlist.json`, `test-discovery-baseline.json`,
…) are **not** budgets and were not touched. Pass/fail policy gates (secrets, SQL rules,
docs/env contract, i18n parity, unit tests) are unchanged — a red test is still a red test.

**Tooling**

- `npm run quality:relax-baselines -- --pct 20 --note velocity_YYYY_MM_DD [--dry-run]` — the
  one-shot relaxation (`scripts/quality/relax-baselines.mjs`); refuses to run twice with the
  same note.
- `npm run quality:headroom [-- --only deadExports,fileSize] [--json out.json --md out.md]` —
  measures every numeric gate the way CI does and prints the remaining headroom per gate
  (`scripts/quality/baseline-headroom.mjs`). The nightly `baseline-headroom` job posts the
  table to the living issue **📈 Baseline headroom (velocity phase)** and adds the
  `headroom-alert` label when any gate is within 10% of its cap or already over it. That issue
  is the early warning: a budget that fills in days means the relaxation is being consumed by
  a few PRs, not by the whole team — look at the offending gate's `_rebaseline_*` notes.

**New-code mode (Clean-as-You-Code) — since 2026-08-30, PR fast-path only**

On `pull_request` events `quality.yml` passes `--base-ref <PR base SHA>` to `check:file-size`,
`check:complexity-ratchets` and `check:dead-code`. For `check:complexity-ratchets` and
`check:dead-code` the gate compares HEAD with the merge-base **restricted to the files the PR
touched** (`scripts/check/newCodeMode.mjs`: the merge-base is materialized in a throwaway
`git worktree`, ESLint/knip run there and on HEAD, the per-file counts are diffed):

- **blocking** — the PR added cyclomatic/cognitive violations or dead exports in files it changed
  (`complexityNewCode=`, `cognitiveComplexityNewCode=`, `deadExportsNewCode=` in the log);
- **advisory** — the global total vs. the frozen baseline. Inherited drift never reds an
  innocent PR; the drift is re-frozen at release reconciliation and watched by the headroom job.

`check:file-size` uses the base ref on its own terms (`scripts/check/check-file-size.mjs`, #8522):
it checks every source and test file in the tree, reads each one's line count at the PR base
with `git show`, and fails a file only when it grows past the larger of its baseline ceiling
(`frozen` / `testFrozen`, or `cap` / `testCap` for a file outside the baseline) and its base
size. A file that already drifted on the base therefore never reds an innocent PR.

`workflow_dispatch` runs, the release-green sweep and the nightly headroom job have no PR base
and keep the absolute (global) comparison. Coverage, duplication and type-coverage stay global
for now (their tools do not produce a per-file diff cheaply) — candidates for the same treatment.

**Closing the phase at v4.0 (LTS = tighter than before, not "back to normal")**

1. On the pure `release/v4.0.0` tip: `npm run quality:headroom --json` for the record, then
   `npm run quality:ratchet -- --update`, `check:file-size --update`,
   `check:complexity-ratchets --update`, `check:dead-code --update`, each typecheck gate's
   `--update` — every baseline drops to the measured value.
2. Delete `_policy` from `quality-baseline.json` (re-arms `--require-tighten` and the nightly
   banking), restore `THRESHOLD = 36` (or higher) in `check-openapi-coverage.mjs`.
3. Tighten beyond measured where the modularization paid off: file-size `cap` back to 1000
   (or 800), coverage floors +5, dead exports 0 for the modularized packages.

## Ratchet Baseline (`quality-baseline.json`)

The ratchet engine (`scripts/quality/check-quality-ratchet.mjs`) reads `quality-baseline.json`
and compares it against the freshly collected `quality-metrics.json`. Any metric that regresses
beyond its epsilon fails the build.

Current tracked metrics:

| Metric                | Direction | Meaning                            |
| --------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `eslintWarnings`      | `down`    | ESLint warning count must not grow |
| `coverage.statements` | `up`      | Statement coverage must not fall   |
| `coverage.lines`      | `up`      | Line coverage must not fall        |
| `coverage.functions`  | `up`      | Function coverage must not fall    |
| `coverage.branches`   | `up`      | Branch coverage must not fall      |

To update the baseline after a genuine improvement:

```bash
npm run quality:ratchet -- --update
git add quality-baseline.json
```

The `--update` flag writes the current measured values into `quality-baseline.json`.
Commit this file alongside the change that improved the metric. A PR that improves a
metric without updating the baseline will be caught by `--require-tighten` (Fase 6A.5,
pending implementation).

### CodeQL ratchet: refresh cadence and manual trigger

`check:codeql-ratchet` reads **repo state, refreshed on a schedule — not per PR.**
`gh api repos/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute/code-scanning/default-setup` reports
`state: configured`, `schedule: weekly`: GitHub's default-setup scan, not a per-push
analysis. Consequence: after a PR that FIXES alerts merges, the ratchet keeps reading
the old, higher count until the next scheduled scan runs — so it reports a regression
on every open PR, including the fixing PR's own follow-ups, until the scan catches up.

**Manual refresh**: `gh workflow run codeql.yml --ref release/vX.Y.Z` re-runs the
analysis and republishes alerts within minutes. Read `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`
first — its header explains it is `workflow_dispatch`-only **because it conflicts with
GitHub's "default setup"** (`CodeQL analyses from advanced configurations cannot be
processed when the default setup is enabled`). Restoring `push`/`pull_request`/
`schedule` triggers requires an **owner action first**: Settings → Code security →
CodeQL: Default → Advanced. Do not add a `schedule:` trigger without that switch — it
will only produce failing runs.

**Tighten the baseline after the count drops** — `node scripts/check/check-codeql-ratchet.mjs
--update` writes the new measured count into `quality-baseline.json` →
`metrics.codeqlAlerts.value`, so the ratchet does not silently permit a regression back
up to the old ceiling. Worked example (2026-09-02/03): PR #12502 fixed 7 real alerts
(13 → 6 measured open); PR #12530 tightened the frozen baseline 11 → 6 to match; the
remaining 6 were then dismissed with per-alert justification down to 0 open.

**Dismissals are the operator's call (Hard Rule #14)** — never dismiss a CodeQL alert
without recording the technical justification in the dismissal comment: `won't fix` for
an upstream-protocol requirement, `used in tests` for a test fixture, `false positive`
for a sanitizer CodeQL cannot see (precedent: `docs/security/ERROR_SANITIZATION.md`).

## Test Retry Policy (WS5.4, v3.8.49)

Retry is per-runner, never a global blanket — a blanket retry converts real regressions
into invisible flakes:

| Runner           | Policy                                                                                                     | Why                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Playwright (e2e) | `retries: 1` in CI only, with `trace: on-first-retry`                                                      | Browser/network timing is genuinely nondeterministic; one retry with a trace turns a flake into a diagnosable artifact |
| Vitest           | NO global retry. A proven-flaky test gets an explicit per-test retry (visible in the diff, reviewed in PR) | Keeps the quarantine list in the repo, never opaque                                                                    |
| node:test (unit) | NO retry, ever                                                                                             | A flaky unit test is a bug in the test — fix it, don't re-roll it                                                      |

Target SLOs once flake telemetry lands (WS5.2/5.3): <1% flake rate per test
("fix now" threshold), ≥95% pass rate per pipeline. Industry reference values —
recalibrate against our own measurements.

## Release-Level Ratchet Drift (WS5.5, v3.8.49)

When a ratchet (file-size, complexity, eslint warnings) regresses on the PURE release
tip — i.e. the COMBINATION of merges regressed it, and no single PR reproduces the
regression on its own branch — the fix belongs to the **release captain, once, on the
release branch**: prefer extraction/refactor; rebaseline only with the documented
justification entry. Never push combination drift onto a contributor PR, and never
rebaseline per-PR (that hides real regressions). Discriminate first: reproduce the
red against the pure tip in a probe worktree before assuming your PR caused it.

## Banking Ratchet Shrinks — the downward direction (#8584)

The ratchet is only half automatic, and it is the wrong half. **Raising** a cap is a
manual JSON edit that takes ten seconds and is the fastest way to unblock a red PR.
**Lowering** one requires someone to run `--update` and commit the result — and until
the `bank-ratchet-shrinks` job landed, no workflow ran it. The measured consequence
(2026-07-25): 18 frozen files already at or under the 800-line new-file cap, the worst
at 132× (`src/shared/validation/schemas.ts`, 19 lines carrying a 2,523 cap); the
complexity ceiling walked `1794 → 2169` across ~37 rebaseline notes with exactly one
decrease (−1); and "tighten via `--update` next cycle" written 31 times and honoured
once. A cap that outlives the code that earned it silently converts every completed
decomposition into a growth allowance for whoever edits the file next.

`nightly-release-green.yml` → job **`bank-ratchet-shrinks`** closes that loop:

|          |                                                                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Runs on  | `schedule` (3×/day) + `workflow_dispatch` — deliberately **not** `push`                                |
| Measures | the highest `release/vX.Y.Z`, same resolution + injection guard as `release-green`                     |
| Writes   | `check:file-size --update` and `check:complexity-ratchets --update` (both shrink-only by construction) |
| Verifies | `npm run check:ratchet-bank` (`scripts/quality/verify-ratchet-bank.mjs`)                               |
| Ships    | one always-current PR against the release branch — force-updated, never spammed                        |

Banking is batched rather than per-push because it has no latency requirement (a shrink
banked within 8h is fine) while a per-merge run would rebuild the PR branch repeatedly
during merge campaigns and pay for a full ESLint walk each time. Detection stays on
push (`release-green`); only banking is batched.

### The safety verifier

The job writes to the baselines unattended, so `verify-ratchet-bank.mjs` is what makes
that acceptable. It diffs the post-`--update` tree against `HEAD` and **aborts the job
before any commit exists** — opening no PR — unless every change is one of:

- a `frozen` / `testFrozen` numeric entry **lowered** or **removed**
- `complexity-baseline.json` → `count` **lowered**
- `quality-baseline.json` → `metrics.cognitiveComplexity.value` **lowered**

Anything else fails: raising a number, adding an entry, changing `cap`/`testCap`, or
deleting/rewriting a `_rebaseline_*` note (those notes are the audit trail for why each
ceiling exists and are stored inside the same `frozen` object as the file entries).
A bot that could raise a cap would be strictly worse than the status quo. Regression
guard: `tests/unit/verify-ratchet-bank.test.ts`.

The job never pushes to `release/*` — a human merges the PR, so a bad measurement
cannot land unreviewed.

## Allowlist Policy

Every gate that cannot fail on pre-existing violations uses a frozen allowlist
(e.g., `KNOWN_STALE_DOC_REFS`, `KNOWN_MISSING`, `KNOWN_RAW_SQL`). The policy is:

**Fix the root cause; use the allowlist only when the violation is pre-existing and
cannot be fixed in the same PR.**

When adding an entry to an allowlist:

1. Include a comment with the justification.
2. Reference the tracking issue (e.g., `// #3498 — Phase 2 feature, not yet implemented`).
3. Remove the entry in the same PR that fixes the violation — a stale entry that no longer
   suppresses an active violation is itself a defect (6A.3 stale-enforcement will
   fail the gate on an orphaned allowlist entry once implemented).

Do **not** add allowlist entries to make tests pass faster. A green gate with a growing
allowlist is a false sense of quality.

### When a gate fails on your PR

1. **Read the gate output carefully** — it tells you exactly which file or symbol violated
   the rule.
2. **Fix the violation** — most gates are deterministic filesystem checks that pass as soon
   as the code is correct.
3. **If the violation is pre-existing** (i.e., you did not introduce it but the gate now
   covers it): add an allowlist entry with a justification comment and a tracking issue.
4. **If the gate is a ratchet** (coverage, ESLint warnings, duplication, complexity):
   your change made the metric worse. Fix the underlying issue, or (rarely) run
   `npm run quality:ratchet -- --update` if the change is intentional and the metric
   degradation is acceptable — but document why in the PR description.
5. **Advisory gates** (`continue-on-error: true`) are informational — they do not block
   merge but appear in the CI summary. Fix them anyway.

---

## Adding a New Gate

1. Create `scripts/check/check-<name>.mjs` (or `.ts`). Policy gates exit 0/1.
   Ratchet-style gates emit a metric to `quality-metrics.json` via `collect-metrics.mjs`.
2. Add `"check:<name>": "node scripts/check/check-<name>.mjs"` to `package.json`.
3. Wire it in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` under the appropriate job
   (policy → `lint` or `docs-sync-strict`; ratchet → `quality-gate`).
4. If it has an allowlist, apply `reportStaleEntries()` from
   `scripts/check/lib/allowlist.mjs` so stale entries are detected automatically.
5. Write a test in `tests/unit/build/` covering the gate's detection logic.
6. Update this document (add a row to the relevant job table).

---

## Agent tooling: LSP-in-the-loop (opt-in)

Beyond the CI gates, OmniRoute ships an **opt-in** `agent-lsp` scaffold
(a project-level `.mcp.json`, Fase 7 Task 15). Create `.mcp.json`
to expose a TypeScript language server to coding agents, so they resolve symbols /
diagnostics **before** writing code — a compile-before-claim companion to
`typecheck:core` that cuts "invented symbol" errors at the source. It is intentionally
not auto-loaded (you pick and verify the MCP↔LSP bridge); a broken entry only logs a
connection error and never breaks sessions.

## Rationalization Backlog (ROI review — Fase 9 Onda 3)

This inventory was reconciled against `ci.yml` on 2026-06-17 (the prior version omitted
`audit:deps`, `check:tracked-artifacts`, `check:lockfile`, `check:licenses`,
`check:dead-code`, `check:cognitive-complexity`, `check:type-coverage`,
`check:codeql-ratchet`, `check:pr-evidence`). An ROI review of the reconciled set
identified the following rationalization candidates. **The merges are mechanical CI
changes; the flips/drops are policy decisions reserved for the operator.** Nothing below
is applied yet.

**Also undocumented above** (advisory, low signal): the `docs-lint` job
(markdownlint + Vale, whole job `continue-on-error`) and the standalone scanner workflows
`semgrep.yml` / `codeql.yml` / `scorecard.yml`. `semgrepFindings: 0` is in
`quality-baseline.json` but is not wired to a blocking ratchet in `ci.yml` — the metric is
currently orphaned.

### Merge / dedup (mechanical, lower risk)

Each candidate was validated against the live gate state on 2026-06-17 (trust-but-verify);
several "obvious" merges turned out to hide debt and are **not** clean drop-ins.

- **`check:docs-sync` runs twice** — standalone in the `lint` job and again inside `check:docs-all` (`docs-sync-strict`) and the husky pre-commit hook. ✅ **DONE** — standalone `lint` invocation removed.
- **CVE scanning** — ❌ **NOT a clean merge.** `audit:deps` hard-fails on any high/critical CVE; `check:vuln-ratchet` (osv) only fails on a _regression_ vs baseline (currently 1 MODERATE). Different semantics — dropping `audit:deps` would lose the absolute high/critical gate. Keep both.
- **Cycle detection** — ✅ **DONE** (#15159 G-01/G-02). The old text here called `check:cycles` "the green, curated" gate and justified keeping it blocking because `check:circular-deps` (dpdm) reported 91 cycles. That green was a **false green**: `check:cycles` scanned 5 subdirectories (450 files), matched only static `import|export … from`, and dropped every `@/` and `@omniroute/open-sse/` specifier, so it could not see the dynamic-import + alias cycles that dominated the repo. Fixed: the gate now walks `src` + `open-sse` (5023 files), collects specifiers from the TypeScript AST (so `import("…")` counts and type-position `typeof import("…")` does not), and resolves tsconfig `paths`. It finds **14** cycles, not 0. Because 14 pre-existing cycles cannot be fixed in a gate PR, `check:cycles` is now a **ratchet** (`--ratchet`, ceiling `metrics.cycles.value = 14` in `quality-baseline.json`, `direction: down`) — it blocks any _regression_ and the count can only fall. CI runs `npm run check:cycles:ratchet`. Burn-down rides with **A-01**. `check:circular-deps` (dpdm) stays advisory as the broader second opinion.
- **Complexity** — ✅ **DONE** (`check:complexity-ratchets` / `eslint.complexity-ratchets.config.mjs`): one ESLint walk, counts by ruleId so cyclomatic+max-lines and cognitive baselines stay independent; individual `check:complexity` / `check:cognitive-complexity` remain for local `--update`.
- **`/api` anti-hallucination** — ✅ **DONE** (`check:api-docs-refs` + `scripts/check/lib/apiRoutes.mjs`): one FS inventory of `src/app/api`, openapi-routes + docs-symbols still report independently; individuals remain for local runs.
- **`check:node-runtime` runs in 11 jobs** — ⚠️ **low ROI.** Each is a separate runner and the check is <1s; total savings ~10s, against losing a cheap per-job guard. Not worth the churn.
- **`typecheck:noimplicit:core` on CI lint** — ✅ **removed from lint job** (was advisory `continue-on-error`); blocking type surface is `typecheck:core` + `check:type-coverage`. Local script retained.

### Flip / decide (operator policy)

- `check:openapi-security-tiers` (advisory) — ❌ **NOT cleanly flippable.** It exits 0 but warns that several `traffic-inspector` routes under `LOCAL_ONLY_API_PREFIXES` lack the `x-loopback-only: true` annotation. Enforcing it requires adding those annotations to `openapi.yaml` first.
- `typecheck:noimplicit:core` (advisory) — largely subsumed by the blocking `check:type-coverage` ratchet. Flip to a ratchet or drop the redundant second `tsc` pass.
- `test:vitest:ui` (now **blocking**) — pre-existing failures are explicitly excluded in `vitest.config.ts` with `// #8618` tracking comments; new failures fail the job.
- `check:secrets` (gitleaks, blocking ratchet frozen at 3 documented false-positives) — allowlist the 3 to reach 0, or demote to advisory. Overlaps GitHub native secret-scanning + `check:public-creds`.
- `check:pr-evidence` (blocking, greps PR-body prose) — high false-positive risk; weakens Hard Rule #18 enforcement if dropped, so this is a genuine policy call.
- `semgrep` (advisory standalone) — overlaps CodeQL for the OWASP families; wire its baseline to a ratchet or drop.

#### `check-key-completeness` — key-set parity gate

`scripts/i18n/check-key-completeness.mjs` (`npm run i18n:check-keys`, job `i18n-ui-coverage`).
Compares the leaf key set of every `src/i18n/messages/<locale>.json` with `en.json` and fails
on any absent or extra leaf, regardless of when the key was added. `__MISSING__:` placeholders
count as present (their content is the ratio gate's business). It is the absolute complement
of the two diff-based/percentage gates: `check-ui-keys-coverage` enforces an 80 % floor per
locale (43 absent keys out of ~13,000 still read 99.7 %) and `check-new-key-coverage` judges
only the keys a PR adds to `en.json`. A locale batch is generated from the `en.json` of the day
its branch is cut and translates for days while the base keeps adding keys; the batch PR adds no
key itself, so both siblings stayed silent when batch 1 (#13044) landed 43 keys short in nine
locales and batch 2 (#13660) 10 keys short in eight (2026-09-15). Fix a red with
`node scripts/i18n/sync-ui-keys.mjs --locale=<codes> --translate-markers`; an `extra` leaf
means the source dropped it — delete it from the locale. `--warn` reports without failing.
`--catalog=cli` runs the same comparison over `bin/cli/locales` (`npm run i18n:check-keys:cli`);
both steps live in job `i18n-ui-coverage`.

#### `check-new-key-coverage` — new-key i18n gate

Sibling of `check-ui-value-drift`. That one catches an English value that was **rewritten**
while its translations were left behind; this one catches an English key that was **added**
while some locales never received it.

`check-ui-keys-coverage` cannot see this class: it enforces a percentage floor per locale, and
eleven absent keys out of ~13,000 leaves coverage at 99.9%. A percentage per language cannot
express "this feature shipped untranslated" — an entire feature can land in a new locale with no
text and never move the number.

The incident it encodes: Phase 3 of the Orchestration Canvas translated its eleven keys across
the 42 locales that existed at the time. Hours later the EU-language batch (#13044) took the repo
to 51 locales, and the nine newcomers (`el`, `et`, `ga`, `hr`, `lt`, `lv`, `mt`, `sl`, `sr`) never
received them. `deepMergeFallback` substitutes English for an absent key, so the failure mode was
untranslated UI rather than blank UI — real, and silent by construction.

Like its sibling it is **diff-aware**, comparing English at the merge base against the working
tree, so pre-existing gaps stay frozen and the gate needed no migration to turn on.

**A `__MISSING__:<english>` marker does not satisfy it (since 2026-09-17).** It used to be the
documented deferral — the runtime falls back to correct English — until eight feature PRs on
2026-09-16 added 61 keys and stamped the marker into all 65 locales instead of translating: this
gate accepted every one, nothing blocked the PRs, and the blocking real-translation ratio gate
then failed on the release tip for everybody (pt-BR 3.2 % > 2.5 % + 0.5). A marker is now judged
as an absent translation. Fix a red with
`node scripts/i18n/sync-ui-keys.mjs --locale=<codes> --translate-markers --batch-size=40`, or
all locales in parallel with `npm run i18n:translate-new-keys` (`scripts/i18n/translate-new-keys.sh`,
detached-safe, refuses to start without the `OMNIROUTE_TRANSLATION_*` env). A key that must stay
English (a pinned product/engine/flag name) belongs in `scripts/i18n/untranslatable-keys.json`,
never behind a marker. `vi` bans markers outright (`tests/unit/i18n-vi-completeness.test.ts`).

#### `check-vitest-exclusions` — parked-test gate

A file in `vitest.config.ts`'s `exclude` list is a test that does not run, and it looks like
coverage to whoever reads the tree. Sixty-two files accumulated behind the comment
`// #8618 — pre-existing failure; remove this exclusion when fixed`. Issue #8618 was closed on
2026-08-11 while the list it tracked grew from 45 entries to 62, each new one inheriting a comment
pointing at a dead issue. When the list was finally measured file by file (#13204), **51 of the 62
passed against the current tree with no source change**.

The gate requires every exclusion that resolves to a real file to (a) name a tracking issue and
(b) appear in `config/quality/vitest-exclusions.json` with its measured status, so adding one is a
reviewable diff in a dedicated file rather than one more line in a 60-entry array. It deliberately
does not re-run the excluded tests — that costs ~10 minutes and belongs in a periodic job; the
inventory records when each was last measured.
