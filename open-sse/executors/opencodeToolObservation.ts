/**
 * opencodeToolObservation.ts — which tool names the gated upstream accepts right now.
 *
 * The free tier inspects the `tools` array, and what it accepts moves. Measured on
 * 2026-09-18: one made-up tool was accepted on `big-pickle` and refused on
 * `nemotron-3.5-lightning-free` and `muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free` — the same body that
 * the first of those had accepted a day earlier. No published artifact carries that rule;
 * the upstream npm package is a 3 KB platform dispatcher. A pinned placeholder is
 * therefore a guess that goes stale between releases.
 *
 * The relayed traffic already carries the answer. A client request that goes out with
 * tools and comes back OK proves which names the upstream accepts, for that surface and
 * that model, at that moment. This module remembers those names so a later request
 * carrying none can borrow them, and forgets them when a borrowed set is refused.
 *
 * Only names are kept — never a schema, a description, or any conversation content — and
 * the placeholder rebuilt from them declares an empty parameter object, so a borrowed name
 * is an entry in a list rather than a callable tool.
 *
 * Leaf module: no internal imports, so the executor and the contract can both use it.
