/**
 * opencodeResponsesStall.ts — opt-in first-byte stall guard for streamed
 * Responses replies in the opencode executor (#13484).
 *
 * A streamed Responses reply opens with `response.created` before any
 * generation, so a 2xx Responses stream that stays silent past the window is
 * stalled, not thinking. Chat Completions streams are left alone: gateways may
 * legitimately hold them until the answer is ready.
 *
 * Worst case on the stall arm: at most 2 first-byte waits per request (one
 * rotation), each bounded by the window; the guarded final direct call can add
 * one more wait without a rotation, so at most 3 waits mixed, all window-bounded.
 *
 * Gated by OPENCODE_RESPONSES_STALL_ROTATION (default off). With the flag off
 * the window is 0 and every guard call hands back the very same result object,
 * so the stream readiness timeout stays the only bound, as before.

 * in chatCore only starts on the response the executor hands back (which then

 * exactly the bound costs the same wall time the readiness check would have,
