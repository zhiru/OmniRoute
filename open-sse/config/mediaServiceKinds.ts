/**
 * Media serviceKinds — derived from the backend registries.
 *
 * The dashboard's `/dashboard/media-providers/[kind]` pages list a provider
 * under a media kind when the provider supports it. Historically this relied on
 * a hand-maintained `serviceKinds` array on every provider in providers.ts,
 * which had drifted badly: ~48 providers were wired into the audio/video/music/
 * image/embedding registries (backend works) but declared no `serviceKinds`, so
 * they never appeared in the UI.
 *
 * This module makes the registries the single source of truth: a provider that
 * appears as a key in a media registry supports that kind, full stop. The UI
 * derives membership from here instead of duplicating it by hand, so adding a
 * provider to a registry automatically surfaces it — no second edit, no drift.
 *
 * `imageToText` is additionally derived from `OCR_PROVIDERS` (see
 * `resolveProviderServiceKinds`): a provider registered in the OCR registry gets
 * `imageToText` for free, no manual `serviceKinds` edit needed. Kinds without any
 * backing registry (webSearch, webFetch, llm) are still declared explicitly via
 * `serviceKinds` on the provider entry; callers union declared + derived sources.
