/**
 * Model eligibility for the `context-1m-2025-08-07` long-context `anthropic-beta`.
 *
 * Only a subset of Claude models qualify for the 1M-context beta. Forwarding the
 * beta to a non-qualifying model (e.g. claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) is a hard 400
 * from the Messages API: "long context beta is not yet available for this
 * subscription". A client can negotiate the beta for one member of a combo and
 * have the SAME request re-routed (combo/fallback) to a less capable sibling, so
 * beta forwarding must be gated on the RESOLVED target model — never blind.
 *
 * Neutral module (no imports) so both `anthropicHeaders.ts` (the merge path) and
 * `claudeCodeCompatible.ts` (the `[1m]`-suffix path) share one source of truth
 * without importing each other.
