/**
 * STRICT_ZERO_COST — an opt-in, stricter sibling of `hidePaidModels`
 * (`paidModelFilter.ts`) for operators who need a hard guarantee against ANY
 * incremental monetary spend, not just "documented as free".
 *
 * `hidePaidModels` answers "is this model classified free in FREE_MODEL_BUDGETS
 * right now?" — a point-in-time catalog fact. It says nothing about whether a
 * `recurring-*`/`one-time-initial` candidate's allowance has since been
 * consumed, and nothing about whether exceeding it is a hard stop or silent
 * pay-as-you-go billing. STRICT_ZERO_COST adds exactly those two checks,
 * before ranking, before dispatch — never after.
 *
 * Design, kept deliberately close to `filterPaidOnlyCandidates`'s own stated
 * goal: "a pure, dependency-light function so the filter is unit-testable in
 * isolation". The live quota lookup (`getUsageForProvider`, cached with a TTL)
 * lives in `freeAccessQuota.ts` and is injected here as a plain function —
 * this file never imports the DB or makes a network call itself.
 *
 * No provider or model name appears anywhere in this file. A candidate passes
 * or fails purely on the metadata it carries (`freeType`, `tos`,
 * `hardStopGuaranteed`) plus, for quota-based types, a `FreeAccessState`
 * resolved elsewhere. A future provider that ships correct metadata is
 * handled automatically; one that doesn't is excluded automatically — see
 * `docs/routing/STRICT_ZERO_COST.md`.
 *
 * ## Connection safety (fixed after code review, see `docs/routing/STRICT_ZERO_COST.md`)
 *
 * A candidate from `virtualFactory.ts`'s connection-based pool represents ONE
 * provider/model pair with a set of *eligible* connections
 * (`allowedConnectionIds`) — the actual connection used at dispatch is chosen
 * later (session stickiness/LKGP), not by this filter. Two invariants follow:
 *
 *   1. The `keyless` shortcut (no live check needed, because no credential
 *      exists) is valid ONLY for candidates that genuinely came from the
 *      no-auth path — identified by `connectionId === SYNTHETIC_NOAUTH_CONNECTION_ID`
 *      (`resilienceCandidateFilter.ts`). A `keyless`-catalogued model reached
 *      through a real DB connection (the same provider also has a
 *      credentialed connection) does NOT get the shortcut — it falls through
 *      to the normal quota-based check like any other freeType, and is
 *      excluded unless that specific connection independently proves SAFE.
 *   2. For a multi-account candidate (`connectionId: null`,
 *      `allowedConnectionIds: [...]`), each connection is checked
 *      INDIVIDUALLY. The returned candidate's `allowedConnectionIds` is
 *      REWRITTEN to exactly the subset proven SAFE — never the full original
 *      list. `autoStrategy.ts` (`open-sse/services/combo/autoStrategy.ts:315-331`)
 *      already intersects further routing against `allowedConnectionIds`
 *      before connection selection, so rewriting it here is enough to make
 *      "verified this connection" and "dispatch used this connection" the
 *      same set, by construction — no new enforcement point needed.
