/**
 * usage/fetcherProviders.ts — the registration list of providers that have a
 * `getUsageForProvider` implementation.
 *
 * Extracted from services/usage.ts (god-file decomposition) so that consumers which only
 * need to know *whether* a provider has a wired fetcher can read the list without pulling
 * in the dispatcher and its ~490-module fetcher graph (DB, sockets, child_process). The
 * provider-plugin manifest (`config/providerPluginManifest.ts`) is one such consumer: it
 * is a JSON-safe config module served over HTTP and must stay a light leaf. Pure data —
 * no imports, no module state — so it cannot introduce a cycle. Behavior-preserving move;
 * `services/usage.ts` re-exports both the value and the derived type, so every existing
 * import path (`services/usage.ts`) keeps working unchanged.
 */

/**
 * Single source of truth for which providers have a `getUsageForProvider`
 * implementation. Consumers like `genericQuotaFetcher.ts` and the provider-plugin
 * manifest reference this so the registration list can't drift from the dispatcher's
 * switch statement.
 *
 * If you add a new provider to the switch in `services/usage.ts`, add it here too.
