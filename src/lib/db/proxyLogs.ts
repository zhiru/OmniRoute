 * sub-query reads `error_type` from the first row by `rowid`, one index seek
 * per failed request on `idx_cl_correlation_id` instead of a pass over the
 * whole call_logs table. The family is computed in a derived table and grouped
 * outside it: grouping on the scalar sub-query's alias in the same SELECT
 * merges distinct families on SQLite. 0 new indexes: the window rides
 * `idx_pl_timestamp`.
