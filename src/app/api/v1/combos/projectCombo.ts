 * the projection can be unit-tested without spinning up the Next.js route.
 *
 * #10968: the projection also reports `accountPinned` per model step — a boolean
 * derived from the stripped `connectionId`, so callers can distinguish a combo
 * that fails over between two accounts of one provider from a duplicated step.
 *
 * #3979: client-facing combo catalogs (the `/v1/combos`, VS Code and LobeHub /
 * OpenCode import surfaces) can opt into advertising the combo's resolved
 * capabilities (multimodal / reasoning / caching) so importing clients enable
 * those features instead of requiring manual config after import.
