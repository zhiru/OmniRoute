 * the gate (omni-code-review LEDGER-3/9):
 *
 *   - `none`       — no key presented (anonymous or session-only caller);
 *   - `unresolved` — a key was presented but no row matches (deleted, rotated, mistyped);
 *   - `invalid`    — the row exists but failed `validateApiKey`
 *                    (is_active / revoked_at / is_banned / expires_at);
 *   - `valid`      — passed the gate; `apiKeyId` and `apiKeyMetadata` are set.
 *
 * `apiKeyId !== null` ⟺ `keyState === "valid"`. Additive field: every consumer
 * that only reads `apiKeyId` keeps working unchanged.

/**
 * Canonical per-record ownership check for API-key-scoped resources (files,
 * batches, …). Four answers, in precedence order — the same model as the
 * sweep scoping in `deleteCompletedBatches()` (GHSA-wvxc-jp3v-5mg5):
 *
 *   - a `manage`/`admin`-scope key (the deployment-time env key, or any user
 *     key explicitly granted that scope) may act on ANY record, instance-wide
 *     — #14481 item 2/LEDGER-5: it has full management-API access everywhere
 *     else, so demoting it to an ordinary single-tenant key here (its own
 *     `apiKeyId` bucket only) was inconsistent, not a security boundary;
 *   - a caller carrying an `apiKeyId` override (an ordinary key, OR a
 *     dashboard session that ALSO presents a key) may act on records owned by
 *     that key only — #14481 item 4/LEDGER-19: `isSessionAuth` used to
 *     short-circuit to `true` BEFORE this check, so a request carrying both a
 *     session cookie and a foreign tenant's key was authorized against that
 *     tenant's records even though the operation is attributed to the key,
 *     not the session. Checking the override FIRST closes that bypass while
 *     leaving a session with NO key override (the ordinary dashboard case)
 *     unrestricted, exactly as before;
 *   - a pure session caller (session auth, no `apiKeyId` override) may act on
 *     ANY record — the operator's own dashboard;
 *   - a record with no owner (null/undefined `api_key_id`) is unattributable
 *     and is denied to every remaining caller — an anonymous request and a
 *     foreign key alike. "No owner" is NOT "no restriction": every file/batch
 *     row has carried `api_key_id` since the table was created, so a null
 *     owner is an anonymous or dashboard-session write (or a batch artifact
 *     inheriting one), and letting any principal read, download or delete it
 *     was GHSA-2jm2-mpx8-6523.
 *
 * `getApiKeyRequestScope` never sets `rejection` — with `REQUIRE_API_KEY=false`
 * the central policy admits both a missing and an invalid bearer as anonymous —
 * so `{ apiKeyId: null, isSessionAuth: false }` is exactly the anonymous shape
 * and must never match a record. A revoked, expired or banned key (fails
 * `validateApiKey`) is folded into that same shape by `getApiKeyRequestScope`
 * itself (#13881) — do not reintroduce a path that trusts `apiKeyId` without
 * that lifecycle gate.

/**
 * The id of the key that should own a record created (or looked up) in this

 * the ungated `x-api-key`/`x-goog-api-key` transport (no anthropic-version,
 * non-Claude UA) is invisible to `extractApiKey()`/`getApiKeyRequestScope()`
 * (`scope.apiKeyId` stays null for it, #13881/round-2), but
 * `enforceApiKeyPolicy()` resolves and validates that same key independently
 * via `extractUngatedClientApiKey()` and hands back a non-null `apiKeyInfo`
 * once the key clears every lifecycle/policy gate (`policy.rejection ===
 * null`). Without this fallback, a write handler persisted `apiKeyId: null`
 * for that transport — an unreadable, undeletable, unaccounted-for row — and
 * an ownership check on that same transport denied the key its own record.
 * `scope.apiKeyId` always wins when set (the ordinary Authorization/anthropic
 * transports already resolved it).
 *
 * A genuinely anonymous, non-session caller (no key resolved by either path,
 * no dashboard session either — `REQUIRE_API_KEY=false`) resolves to the
 * shared {@link ANONYMOUS_OWNER_ID} sentinel instead of `null` — #14332
 * option (b): the row it creates is then readable/deletable/usable by that
 * SAME anonymous caller later, because `canAccessOwnedRecord()`'s
 * `recordApiKeyId === scope.apiKeyId` comparison succeeds against the
 * sentinel. See the doc comment on {@link ANONYMOUS_OWNER_ID} for the
 * (shared-across-anonymous-callers, not per-caller) threat model this
 * implies. A dashboard-session caller with no key still resolves to `null`
 * unchanged — it does not need an owner id, since `canAccessOwnedRecord()`
 * already grants a session every record unconditionally, and folding it
 * into the anonymous sentinel would make a session-created row readable by
 * any anonymous caller too.
