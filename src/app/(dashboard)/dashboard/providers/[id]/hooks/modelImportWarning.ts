 *
 * The bug: `extractImportWarning` above surfaces the fallback warning as a log
 * line, but the modal's headline `status` stayed `allModelsAlreadyImported` (or
 * `noModelsFound`). Both read as authoritative answers while remote discovery had
 * in fact failed and the response came from the local catalog — so an operator
 * concluded there was nothing to import and the missing models stayed missing.
 *
 * `degraded` is computed with the SERVER's own rule
 * (`isDegradedDiscovery`, the dependency-free leaf at
 * `src/app/api/providers/[id]/sync-models/degradedLocalCatalog.ts`) rather than a
 * second local copy, so the dashboard and the API cannot drift apart. That module
 * is a pure leaf by design, so importing it here pulls nothing server-only into the
 * client bundle.
 *
 * Note `intentional: true` — for reka / voyage-ai / t3-web the local catalog IS
 * the intended and only discovery source (#5460, #5465), so that case must stay
 * non-degraded or Import would report a false failure for them.
